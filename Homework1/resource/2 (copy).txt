	<text>French siteHardmachas been keeping its ear to the ground when it comes to Apple's Final Cut video processing suites,noting todaythat it has heard that revised versions of the company's Final Cut offerings are likely to debut in March or early April.  The reportreiteratesprevious claims that the company may not be able to deliver all of the improvements hoped for by professional-level users, although the updates are still reported to be "substantial".AS we reported earlier, all version of Final Cut should be unveiled in March or early April. It should be a substantial update when compared to the previous version, but not sure it could bring all new features expected by all Pro users.According to today's report, Apple has separate versions of Final Cut running as betas for Mac OS X Snow Leopard and Lion, with some features claimed to be Lion-only due to changes to QuickTime in the forthcoming operating system update.  Mac OS X Lion is not scheduled to launch, however, until"summer" 2011.Last year, following concerns overrumorsthat Apple will be focusing the next version of Final Cut more on mainstream users than professional-level users, both Steve Jobs andApplesought to reassure customers that the next version will be "awesome" and satisfy professional users.Hardmacalso weighs in on a couple of other topics in today's report: Xserve and Blu-ray.  According to the report's sources, there continues to be substantial turmoil over the imminentdiscontinuationof Apple's rackmountable server line due topoor sales.  A number of high-profile users, including Apple director and former Genentech chairman Art Levinson, have reportedly complained about the discontinuation, and whileHardmacindicates that "this storm is maybe not over", it is unclear if Apple is contemplating some alternative to canceling the Xserve line.With regards to Blu-ray, sources indicate that Jobs still considers the technology to be a"bag of hurt", with DRM restrictions and licensing issues that make the format unattractive.  According to the report, Jobs noted during a recent internal meeting that he is "ashamed" that Apple's name is associated with the Blu-ray format through its position as a member of the Blu-ray Disc Association's board of directors, a role it has heldsince 2005.</text>

	<text>I really want to have an opinion on this but the details are so thin that it's really difficult to do so.Also, I'm keenly aware that some &quot;professionals&quot; complain when anything consumerish touches their programs. See Aperture 3 and the fringe whining about how they added 'Faces' to it. Guess what, you don't have to use 'Faces' in Aperture if you don't want to. Get over yourself.So when I hear that Final Cut &quot;might not be as professional&quot; I always wonder if it's that kind of complaining. The attitude of &quot;well they added 20 pro features, but the 2 new consumer features really bug me.&quot;But who knows? We'll have to wait and see.</text>

	<text>It's simple.  People WANT HD content.  iTunes does not have the most attractive pricing for such content when you do the comparison of a downloadable file versus an actual disc-in-hand.If Apple is not going to lower the prices of the downloadable HD content to sub-$10 then allow Blu-Ray playback and burning natively.It's also funny that Jobs has issues with DRM on BDR...  Have you tried to play a movie you bought on iTunes on a different device at all?  Or even try to burn it to a DVD????</text>

They weren't finished with the new re-write so they just threw up a few new features in the old version to buy themselves another year.If they weren't doing a re-write than the last update would've been more substantial, I think.</text>

People whine about optical media, but it's far more efficient and practical to have blu-ray than to download and store 25-50GB movie files for the full HD resolution and sound. The iTunes HD stuff is pretty weak IMO. That said, I don't feel blu-ray drives would be necessary in a lot of the computers, particularly the laptops.</text>

	<text>This is what happens when a company want support another technology because of rivalry. We all know Jobs won't support Blu-Ray to promote iTunes. Well, I'm sorry Steve but iTunes does not offer 1080P and HD Audio. Sure some people may not need it, but it is a huge selling point and people are buying Blu-Rays.Most of the time, Blu-rays can be had for cheaper than iTunes and it comes with a digital copy and dvd.</text>

BluRay is a &quot;bag of hurt&quot; because of its DRM restrictions? Then what are Apple's iGadgets and the DRM-infested iTunes (movie) content that he is selling? Mountains of hurt?I've never experienced more hurtful DRM crap than the stuff that Apple is selling. At the moment, there are only two companies on the market that sell DRMed product that don't make me feel abused and cheated: Amazon with their Kindle store and Valve with their Steam store.In my experience, Apple is the most abusive company when it comes to DRM, so maybe His Steveness should just shut the **** up. The only reason why he does not want to sell Macs with BluRay players is that he is afraid that this would cut into their iTunes sales. Who needs expensive, DRM-infested and inferior quality movie downloads when you can have better quality on a physical medium for the same price? Right: Nobody. That's why you won't ever see a Mac with a BluRay drive.</text>

	<text>All I want is for Apple to provide native AVCHD support, instead of requiring transcoding into Apple Intermediate Codec (tantamount to an admission of failure, in this age of HD camcorders).I recently recorded a 1.5 hour church Christmas show on a new camera I just bought, which records AVCHD video on SD cards.  I was asked by a friend to burn a DVD of the show for her grandfather to watch.  No fancy editing, just pull the footage off the camera, trim the beginning and end, burn to DVD.On my (granted, a bit old) 2.2 GHz Core 2 Duo MBP:I plugged the card into the computer, opened iMovie.  Selected thelow-resolutionimport (half of the 1080p resolution).  The import took about 2 hours (e.g. almost real time).  The AIC file it generated took about 3 times the space as the original (25 gigs).Only then was I able to use iMovie to trim the ends, but then I had to export the project to the Media Library at the &quot;large&quot; setting --this took about 3 hours -- andonly thenwas I finally able to use this video in an iDVD project.Meanwhile, a friend at the church wanted a copy of my footage, so I gave him the memory card.  He simply opened up the card in his Windows 7 computer, navigated to the .MTS video files, and copied them onto his hard drive.  This took about 10 minutes.  He then opened up Premiere, dragged one of the .MTS files onto the timeline, and was able to immediately scrub the timeline and view the footage I'd shot.Imagine that.  Simply copying the original file and opening it, instead of spending hours importing/transcoding and taking up gobs more disk space too.As a result I am seriously considering dual-booting Windows 7 on my MBP so I can import and edit AVCHD video clips (by copying the .MTS files, not by importing into iMovie libraries in AIC).Consider that I switched to Apple computers over 7 years agobecauseof how deftly they handled DV video over Firewire compared to their PC counterparts.  I really feel the tables have been turned here. I really hope to see some improvement -- and soon!</text>

	<text>The DRM requirements for Blu-ray are atrocious. That's why if you're a PC power user you probably own Slysoft's AnyDVD HD.Microsoft had to go as far as to implement a system-wide DRM protection scheme for both audio and video outputs in Windows Vista and 7.It's one thing if Apple could get away with creating a Blu-ray player application that meets the DRM standards. It's another if they have to implement a content protection system for Mac OS X.At least with FairPlay, it's confined to QuickTime.</text>

GNU Public license requires you to release source code for any changes you make ; I'm very sure that either Apache or BSD license does not require the same.Apple should avoid using o/s products that use GNU licenses for 'sensitive' components.  In fact, many companies avoid GNU licensed products like the plague, it can be a 'bag of hurt'!So, Apple could integrate the DRM quite easily, if they really wanted to.Blue Ray in OSX would be great.   I have many High Def movies from my HD camera that I'd love to put on to a BluRay disk and give to other people.  Digital often isn't practical for these people.</text>

No, you didn't. Why? Because those DRM layers are somewhere in the proprietary parts of the OS that they won't ever show you.Must Apple Open Source anything from their OS? No. Why? Because the relevant platform parts are based upon code that was released under the BSD license, which allows for closing the source code.</text>

The storage capacity of this media is exactly what we need for higher end video and larger files.Sure the cost per disc is a bit outrageous right now but as technology increases and demand for them rises, we'll see the price reflect as well.Including BR drives as a standard is definitely unnecessary, but as an option to be installed on a custom machine is the way to go!</text>

The vocal minority is likely not a minority at all.  I have 8 xserves spread through 4 data centers that serve as authentication servers for ~9,000 macs.  Rest assured I have sent my thoughts to Apple on the discontinuation of the Xserve.I can't put a Mac Pro in a datacenter.  It doesn't work like that.  And in the enterprise, there's no such thing as a production server that sits under someones desk.While those technical issues suck, the other issue here is that Apple is discontinuing an enterprise marketed product with under a years notice.  That's bad.  Very bad.  Many companies have hedged their OS X Support bets on the Xserve product and to pull their solution without offering a reasonable amount of time to determine a migration strategy is just bad.  No respectable company should do that.</text>

	<text>Many of us are correct, along with SJ, in saying that BD support is much more complicated than it appears.  The drive is one thing, but keep in mind those updates we all download to our BD players every few months.  They are masked as &quot;Firmware&quot; updates but in reality are nothing more than glorified copyright/decryption scripts.  Do you honestly think Apple wants to be bound to an external body who would force them to release an OsX.x.x update just for the ability for a small user segment to be able to play the latest batch of BDiscs?I used to edit video on Avid Express Pro and could never update Quicktime or OsX without getting the go-ahead from Avid as their software was never compatible with the newest feature set or fix released from Apple.  And I was a single user on my own system, not in a shared environment using other third party software and hardware that has its own compatibility issues and restrictions.  I imagine the average user would not want to look on the back of a BD for the disclaimer, &quot;Will not work with Quicktime Version X.x or older and OsX.x.x or older&quot;.</text>

It's a...fair price.  But there is OBVIOUSLY heavy compression to get the file size down.  Yeah, broadband internet is capable and faster than it was even as short as 5 years ago but...the download time has got to be in excess of 10 minutes.  For a compressed HD movie.  If Apple was selling Blu-Ray downloads (just for argument's sake), I'm sure no one would want to be bothered downloading at least 12GB.  By that time, spend the extra $10 and buy the damn disc.  Or, better yet, Netflix or Blockbuster and get Blu-Ray by mail for ~$10 a month then use your home theater to enjoy FullHD video and better sound.  How does this NOT make sense?Blu-Ray playback on the Mac, I don't care so much.  As I said, I'd rather enjoy any Blu-Ray (commercial or homegrown) in the home theater.  Blu-Ray AUTHORING, on the other hand, I am very hopeful for.That's what sets aside the use of native Blu-Ray in OSX between the casual and pro user.</text>

In 4-5 years, I think we'll finally reach the point where Blu-ray is defacto and DVD is on the decline.I agree, 4-5 years is not reasonable. Maybe like 5-10 when the majority of consumers have portable devices like the iPod and a wireless communication in homes is a standard, not just between people but other devices as well. Also when we start to see more and more car manufacturers adding AUX inputs / iPod connection ports / built-in hard drives and removing disc players is when we will see discs go the way of VHS and tape decks.But that is easily going to be much later in this decade.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bythejdMany of us are correct, along with SJ, in saying that BD support is much more complicated than it appears.  The drive is one thing, but keep in mind those updates we all download to our BD players every few months.  They are masked as &quot;Firmware&quot; updates but in reality are nothing more than glorified copyright/decryption scripts.  Do you honestly think Apple wants to be bound to an external body who would force them to release an OsX.x.x update just for the ability for a small user segment to be able to play the latest batch of BDiscs?Why release OS updates ?  Just release AACS updates on their own, no need to increment the OS X version number at all.The fact is, AACS support is the only thing that is lacking in OS X currently to enable Blu-ray playback.  The rest of the DRM scheme is the same thing used by iTunes.</text>

Rest assured I have sent my thoughts to Apple on the discontinuation of the Xserve.I can't put a Mac Pro in a datacenter.  It doesn't work like that.  And in the enterprise, there's no such thing as a production server that sits under someones desk.While those technical issues suck, the other issue here is that Apple is discontinuing an enterprise marketed product with under a years notice.  That's bad.  Very bad.  Many companies have hedged their OS X Support bets on the Xserve product and to pull their solution without offering a reasonable amount of time to determine a migration strategy is just bad.  No respectable company should do that.Good point, let's just hope that in the smoke of this fire we will see a new and better product to be it's successor.  And not a Mac Pro Server.  A MP Server is good for a school's computer lab but not a major company.</text>

My hope is Apple is going to finally break down and let OS X Server run in non-Apple virtual environments.  We have a very robust vSphere setup for our main Windows servers and a handful of XServes for Apple authentication / management.  It would be awesome to be able to take full advantage of the reliability, storage, and performance we already have in place.</text>

Though I don't believe they will go quite as swiftly or decisively as VHS tapes, they will be outmoded by a new, better format that doesn't require motors, lights, or rubber bands to make it work.Really 4-5 years eh??

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byalent1234it's not the drive, you have to add DRM to the OS. it's probably a big deal since a lot of OS X is open source and it's against the BD consortium's rules to release the source code for the DRMWow. Speaking sincerely, statements like this confuse me. Why announce, &quot;I imagine it might work *this* way,&quot; when you don't have to guess? The facts are easy enough to find. If you don't know the answer, why not look it up? And if you don't feel like looking up the answer, why bother guessing at it?The open-source aspect of OSX has nothing to do with Blu-Ray's DRM. Apple could absolutely implement the appropriate DRM without exposing its source code. You'll notice that Adobe hasn't had to open-source, say, Photoshop in order to release a Mac version. Also, an enormous chunk of Apple's OS code (mostly the UI stuff, but other things as well) is closed-source.The BD consortium's &quot;rules&quot; have nothing to do with it. While the DRM required for Blu-Ray is incredibly restrictive, Jobs also has an incentive to keep Blu-Ray off the Mac. (Blu-Ray will probably disappear in the next 5-10 years, superseded by downloaded content). Since Apple already offers downloadable HD content, they have no reason to offer Blu-Ray support--it would just slow their customer base's transition to the inevitable downloaded content, costing them both money and the development time required to implement Blu-Ray support.So between the Blu-Ray's licensing/DRM requirements and the coming transition to &quot;pure&quot; downloaded content, Blu-Ray really is &quot;a bag of hurt,&quot; as Jobs suggests. But Apple is essentially telling its users to suck it and wait until 10-50 GB downloads are commonplace. As a member of the user base, I don't appreciate this. It's pro-Apple but anti-consumer. Apple and its OS have many wonderful attributes, but consumer-friendly business decisions are not among them as often as they should be.Jobs is a control freak, and his products generally benefit from this. But the flip side of the control coin is the vaguely fascist undercurrents that permeate Apple's products and business decisions. Bill Gates took huge amounts of criticism for years, and much of it was completely justified. But in retirement, he's become one of the smartest, most insightful philanthropists around.  (Really. He does his homework and his foundation funds things that make enormous differences in the world).So yes, I like Steve's products--and I buy them. But when it comes down to who I'd want to sit next to at a dinner party, it's gotta be Bill. He's a lot dorkier than Steve, but I'll bet he's got more interesting things to say once the topic moves beyond computers.(Neither has responded to my latest invitation).Cheers,Jason</text>

	<text>I don't care about Blu-Ray, I don't want another disk that costs a lot and takes ages to burn. Burning a DVD is a pain already as it is, taking 15 minutes to burn a freaking disc.The future is in small, reusable mediums such as USB drives that you buy once and re-use as many times as you like. It's more eco-friendly, allows for large storage, they're fast and not fragile. They don't require a &quot;drive&quot; with motors and mechanics inside, and take up a ridiculous amount of space in today's increasingly thin notebooks.The idea of &quot;another disk with more capacity&quot; is the wrong one, I think. People should take new approaches to mobile media.I also don't see the point in paying more just to get a slightly higher resolution movie, for which you need a special high-resolution screen anyway. Also, the difference cannot be seen if you sit far enough from the TV screen.Downloads are fast today, you can rent a movie on iTunes and play it without waiting even on a relatively slow, 4mbps connection. This will get much better soon, as ISPs start offering cheaper and faster connections.</text>

	<text>so far the only good cloud model i've seen is Steam. you buy a game and can download it as many times as you wantitunes does this with Apps. no way i'm buying electronic HD movies and then have to worry about  where to store them. i'll just buy the shiny disk that has better quality than iTunes and can be taken to other people's homes to play.netflix streaming is nice but the selection sucks. and they actually lost rights to some content. i'm looking at cancelling my subscription</text>

It sounds like you were under the gun and were rushed for time which resulted in poor planning on your part.The low-resolution import is actually a slower import because it has to downsize the footage so you're really adding an extra step in there.  Keep the resolution as high as possible next time and you'll be better off.   Instead of trying to save disk space, get a faster external hard drive for editing and copy your footage there before you point iMovie to the import.  It'll make a difference. Using an internal laptop drive and reading from the SD card during the editing process is just asking for trouble.If you have a copy of Toast, it'll take the .mts files as well and create a DVD out of them.

	<text>Here's my thoughts:BluRay: I'd really like to see it.  For these reasons:-Higher Quality than iTunes downloads-Better &amp; more features than iTunes (behind the scenes, multiple language tracks, etc.)-Cheap backup methodAnd even if iTunes downloads got the same quality &amp; features as BluRay, do you know how long it'll take to download/stream?  In the US, internet speeds are still cr**-tastic and will take several minutes, if not hours, to even buffer enough of the movie to watch it.Plus, burnable BluRay discs are still cheaper than flash drives of comparable size.  On Best Buy's website, you can get a 3-pack of 25 GB BluRay Discs.  On dealram.com, a 16 GB flash drive will cost you $26, 32 GB for $46 and 64 GB for $132.  Sure Blu-Ray may not be rewritable, but for basic archive service, they're fine.Last thing about BluRay is if Steve Jobs is &quot;ashamed&quot; of being associated w/ BluRay for being on its board or whatever, why not just get off it?For the xServe, sure they might not have sold many, but that doesn't make them unimportant.  Plus, I'd like to know why Apple didn't put them into its data center?  Why not make the xServe good enough for its own data center?  My guess: servers aren't &quot;sexy&quot; enough.For Final Cut: please be 64-bit Cocoa-goodness.  While I don't use it, I have  a few friends who do.  WOuld help immensely.  If I were in the film industry, I wouldn't mind waiting a few extra months if it meant having agoodproduct rather than amehkind of product.With Faces in Aperture, I kind of like it.  For people who don't want it, I don't see why youhaveto use it.  I'd be more concerned about Apple dumbing down the features than adding some &quot;consumerish&quot; features that some people might find useful.  I didn't like the difference between iMovie '06 and '08.  '06 had a lot of good, basic editing things that '08 got rid of.  I like making chapter markers, transitions, basic effects, etc. '09 and '10 were better.  I don't need totally fancy stuff.  Just some basic editing stuff for when someone gets married or something, I like to make slideshows/home movies.  Just something that I could  make something nice with.[/rant]</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byjaw04005The DRM requirements for Blu-ray are atrocious. That's why if you're a PC power user you probably own Slysoft's AnyDVD HD.Microsoft had to go as far as to implement a system-wide DRM protection scheme for both audio and video outputs in Windows Vista and 7.It's one thing if Apple could get away with creating a Blu-ray player application that meets the DRM standards. It's another if they have to implement a content protection system for Mac OS X.At least with FairPlay, it's confined to QuickTime.Ding Ding Ding.The amount of changes to the core system of OSX would not only be a giant engineering challenge, but also break an immense amount of media-related software and bring far more restrictions to the platform about how you can use and manipulate media.This isn't a stand against Blu-Ray the physical format, this is a stand against over-reaching DRM.And before anyone says anything, Fairplay != BR DRM. Fairplay is confined to quicktime, and BR DRM covers the overall system.Apple does not want to compromise internal architecture to meet the desires of a single external organization.I would love BR, but I agree with Apple's stance on this matter.Steve Jobs would love to give you BluRay, but not with these costs. It would also be a PR nightmare to have a data-only BluRay drive and have to explain it to people. Much better PR to just keep it off the system completely.What we should do is Lobby for the BR consortium to allow for BR to be played back with a 3rd party only solution, thereby allowing apple to make a BluRay app (Similar to DVD). But as anyone familiar with the matter will tell you, it will not / can not happen.Karl P</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byWinniThis is not even remotely an argument.Did you find Apple's own DRM implementation anywhere in Darwin, which would be the Open Source parts of Mac OS X? No, you didn't. Why? Because those DRM layers are somewhere in the proprietary parts of the OS that they won't ever show you.Must Apple Open Source anything from their OS? No. Why? Because the relevant platform parts are based upon code that was released under the BSD license, which allows for closing the source code.Apple's DRM still allows you to output sound and video without copy protection (ie, apps like Audio Hijack Pro can hijack and record audio originating from DRM-ed sources, in the same way DVI outputs video without any DRM attached to it).BluRay requires that the DRM reaches right into the monitor so nobody can capture any DRM content digitally. That is another level of protection. Now, I do not know whether the open-source foundations of OS X would cause any problems in implementing such a DRM but BluRay DRM is definitely different from FairPlay DRM.</text>

If your library or your Netflix deliveries are Blu-ray, now you can't watch them. Same goes in your house, if you want to watch something while working on something else on your computer, you are stuck if your computer can't play blu-ray. Especially, for Netflix, who doesn't send the Blu-ray/DVD combo discs, it is really incovenient to have to decide which format to request the disc in, based on where you might be watching it.While the Windows machines have had no problems playing Blu-ray for years, it is sad that Apple keeps putting this feature off.</text>

	<text>I have AppleTV for our family room 54&quot; Panasonic Plasma TV using internal TV speakers.  Viewing distance of 12 feet.  AppleTV is more than enough for this.  I watched National Lampoons Christmas Vacation in 720P HD with 2 channel audio on Apple TV through netflix streaming.  More than adequate.However, my media room with a 1080P projector with 120&quot; screen and viewing distance of 12 feet requires a Bluray player.  I tried netflix streaming as well as iTunes content.  Bleh!!  Bluray is a requirement for this!!  Nothing streaming even comes close for this.  Also, HD Audio is a requirement.  I use PS3, higher end HK AVR 745 (A/V receiver) and 5.1 better quality speakers (about $3000 for the speakers).I guess Apple does not want to play in this market.  I can empathize.  I don't care if I play my Bluray content from a PC or a dedicated Bluray player.  I actually prefer a dedicated player!  The only advantage may be to rip bluray content into the Mac (which you can do using third party drives and a ripper).  But I was told that lossless audio does not work properly.Also, I have bought Bluray disks for as low as $6 during the holiday season - on sale.  I bought Toy Story 1 and 3 for $25 together in Bluray.  I can rent bluray as part of monthly rentals through Blockbuster and Netflix and even redbox (individually - only $1.50).  AppleTV rentals are a lot more expensive for lower quality content.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bybaryonI don't care about Blu-Ray, I don't want another disk that costs a lot and takes ages to burn. Burning a DVD is a pain already as it is, taking 15 minutes to burn a freaking disc.The future is in small, reusable mediums such as USB drives that you buy once and re-use as many times as you like. It's more eco-friendly, allows for large storage, they're fast and not fragile. They don't require a &quot;drive&quot; with motors and mechanics inside, and take up a ridiculous amount of space in today's increasingly thin notebooks.The idea of &quot;another disk with more capacity&quot; is the wrong one, I think. People should take new approaches to mobile media.I also don't see the point in paying more just to get a slightly higher resolution movie, for which you need a special high-resolution screen anyway. Also, the difference cannot be seen if you sit far enough from the TV screen.Downloads are fast today, you can rent a movie on iTunes and play it without waiting even on a relatively slow, 4mbps connection. This will get much better soon, as ISPs start offering cheaper and faster connections.As I said in a previous post, movies in iTunes, I find, often had lower quality than a DVD/BluRay of the same resolution.  Plus, many iTunes movies don't have the behind the scenes featurettes, closed captioning, etc.  Plus, no resell value for downloads.As for BluRay versus something like a USB flash drive, I agree, flash drives are easier to use, but are more expensive.  Plus, I'm the IT guy at a middle school and I've see a lot of really shoddy flash drives.  Some of it may be from the 800 or so hormonally challenged 11-14 year olds, but a lot of it is also poor build quality in the flash drives.  But no technology is 100% idiot proof yet 100% usable.  Besides, make something idiot-proof &amp; someone will make a better idiot.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bybdkennedy1Anyone hear of an external Blu-Ray player?Yes, but you still can't use it to play back blu-ray discs and burning to them is only via Toast.And then try authoring a blu-ray movie disc with a bespoke menu from all that beautiful HD footage you've captured on your video camera/DSLR. You can't - from FCP you can burn blu-ray disc using COMPRESSOR(!) and only have a choice of 6 templates.However a truly bespoke disc can be made with Adobe software/Windows/PC hardware but not on an all singing, all dancing Mac 'which just works'.A lot of people here are saying they can't see why they would ever need blu-ray on their Mac. However, there are also a lot of people who would love it and will simply be forced over to Windows and Adobe. They are the people who use Macs to produce rather than consume media.I don't care if something is 'bag of hurt'. This is the business Apple are in. Simple as. Would any of us turn around to our customers and say 'Yes, we can do it but we don't want to because it's a bit tricky really. We're going to spend our time making the iTunes store interface even more confusing instead'? What is the point in Apple having professional video production software if their computers can't actually output the finished product to the current up and coming disc format of the time? Blu-ray needs to become a btooptionin the Apple Store. I fully understand not every body needs it and shouldn't have to pay for it.Does my memory serve me correct in thinking Apple dragged their heals adopting CD-R and DVD as well?Apple dropping a high level professional format (Xserve) with such a short warning period is unprofessional and is going to leave a very sour taste in many IT professionals mouths for a long time.I feel Apple is happily dropping its support for professionals and is becoming purely a consumer electronics company (aka Sony) and is going to try its hardest to make consumers adopt whichever formats it sees best with regards to their own interests, which is a real shame.</text>

	<text>c't (german magazin)has compared different video on demand services and iTunes had all the worst picture quality.Apple also uses no CABAC -&gt; e.g.http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.ph...94#post1431694Quote:CABAC, or context adaptive binary arithmetic coding, is used by x264 to reduce the bitrate needed for a given quality by 15%. This makes it very cool and very useful, and it should be left on whenever possible. However, it is incompatible with the iPod 5.5G, andmakes the AppleTV struggle. So turn it off for those. CABAC is a kind of entropy coding, which means that it compresses data by making shorthand symbols to represent long streams of data. The &quot;entropy&quot; part means that the symbols it uses the most often are the smallest. When you disable CABAC, another entropy coding scheme gets enabled, called CAVLC (context adaptive variable-length coding). CAVLC is a lot less efficient, which is why it needs 15% more bitrate to achieve the same quality as CABAC.http://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/x264OptionsThis is an important H.264 Feature to save Bitrate.720p is not bad. It can be goot. But iTunes 720p is bad</text>

You're right, I was trying to get this off my plate as quickly as possible, and I acknowledge that my machine was not optimized for the process (older laptop, internal drive and pressed for free disk space -- in fact I spent an hour offloading files from my HD onto my NAS in order to make room for the editing I was about to do).Sounds like my solutions are:(a) Use Toast(b) Use Adobe PremiereI notice that neither solution uses Apple-native solutions. Both solutions will involve spending money on software (granted Toast isn't that expensive).   &quot;Upgrade to a faster machine&quot; is also implicit. This is what I think is kind of sad. I won't post my entire &quot;why I switched to Mac&quot; story here, but the gist of it was that, at the time, I was struggling to edit DV video with my top-of-the-line, spec'ed out Dell workstation laptop running pro NLE software, but my friend had a several-years-older Titanium PowerBook G4 that ran circles around my machine.  He imported, edited, did full-screen preview playback, etc. without rendering (well, iMovie was doing background transition rendering) and without skipping frames like my Windows machine did.  All using the FREE built-in iLife software.  That impressed me so much that I bought my own PowerBook a few months later.  It's not that his machine was faster (in fact, I'm certain it wasn't) but Apple tuned their softwarejust sousing techniques like background rendering to make itfeelfaster.I want to point out here that I'm not a pro (though I dabbled with semi-pro projects for a while). I don't really want to set up an editing workstation. I'm just an average guy with a Mac laptop trying to make a DVD of a concert he recorded on an HD camera.  Sounds like the kind of typical common task that Apple used to make really easy and elegant.</text>

	<text>The root of the issue is the requirement for compliance to a secured HDPC connection despite it not providing any benefit to the end user or content owner. As of now, HDCP DRM is a complete waste of time and money and has been a failure at it's original goal of reducing piracy via analog holes.Frankly the best copy protection for Blu-Ray has always been the size of the RAW data.The Blu-Ray consortium should consider this requirement obsolete and allow players to ignore the flag for full quality playback. This would allow options for users to play back content w/o embedded OS support (increasing market share). There are already many third party Blu-Ray drives available and a Mac (and Linux) Blu-Ray media players could be written w/o OS cooperation.</text>

I'm watching them either on a 47&quot; 1080p screen or on my projector (putting out a 100&quot; picture).1080p video looks fantastic.  The Dolby TrueHD soundtracks are really great on a quality 7.1 surround system.Where can I find the 1080p/TrueHD streaming movies on the iTunes Store?Oh yes, and thanks to smart shopping, sales, and Previously-Viewed, my movies cost on average less than $10 each.  The &quot;under $10&quot; section in iTunes is remarkably thin...</text>

	<text>Blu-ray may eventually come to the Mac, but not before the MacBook Pro begins shipping without an optical drive.  The biggest issue is not DRM, but battery drain.Once the optical drive has been phased out of the portables, then Blu-ray may show up in the iMac, Mac Pro, and Mac Mini.  At that point Blu-ray will also likely be available in the external optical drive.  That way watching a Blu-ray Disc will not drain the battery and the issue will be moot.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bymanu chaoApple's DRM still allows you to output sound and video without copy protection (ie, apps like Audio Hijack Pro can hijack and record audio originating from DRM-ed sources, in the same way DVI outputs video without any DRM attached to it).BluRay requires that the DRM reaches right into the monitor so nobody can capture any DRM content digitally. That is another level of protection. Now, I do not know whether the open-source foundations of OS X would cause any problems in implementing such a DRM but BluRay DRM is definitely different from FairPlay DRM.Wrong, iTunes require HDCP to be present to the monitor connection, same as Blu-ray.  OS X already supports HDCP, so it's not even a problem for Blu-ray.  The problem is AACS, which is just the encryption module for Blu-ray.Quote:Originally Posted byiindigoI really can't believe the number of people in this thread that are just fine and dandy with highly draconian, OS-level DRM being implemented system-wide simply for the playback of a stupid video disc...I don't mind DRM like FairPlay and Steam's. It's reasonable and doesn't extend past their respective apps. DRM that encompasses the entire OS, though? Screw that. Screw it long and hard.Fairplay requires the same DRM that extends passed your playback app.  HDCP.  Look it up, OS X already supports it.I can't believe how many people don't know the first thing about the DRM requirements of BD and think they can comment on it.</text>

Compare that to the Sony standalone Blu-Ray player I had, which took a minute just topower up(yes, I timed it).  Unacceptable.I hope they've got better since then, but I imagine some of the cheapo players are still slow.As for the menu interfaces, well, that was the case with DVDs too...Sometimes there's something to be said for the old tech.

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bynotjustjayAll I want is for Apple to provide native AVCHD support, instead of requiring transcoding into Apple Intermediate Codec (tantamount to an admission of failure, in this age of HD camcorders).I recently recorded a 1.5 hour church Christmas show on a new camera I just bought, which records AVCHD video on SD cards.  I was asked by a friend to burn a DVD of the show for her grandfather to watch.  No fancy editing, just pull the footage off the camera, trim the beginning and end, burn to DVD.On my (granted, a bit old) 2.2 GHz Core 2 Duo MBP:I plugged the card into the computer, opened iMovie.  Selected thelow-resolutionimport (half of the 1080p resolution).  The import took about 2 hours (e.g. almost real time).  The AIC file it generated took about 3 times the space as the original (25 gigs).Only then was I able to use iMovie to trim the ends, but then I had to export the project to the Media Library at the &quot;large&quot; setting --this took about 3 hours -- andonly thenwas I finally able to use this video in an iDVD project.Meanwhile, a friend at the church wanted a copy of my footage, so I gave him the memory card.  He simply opened up the card in his Windows 7 computer, navigated to the .MTS video files, and copied them onto his hard drive.  This took about 10 minutes.  He then opened up Premiere, dragged one of the .MTS files onto the timeline, and was able to immediately scrub the timeline and view the footage I'd shot.Imagine that.  Simply copying the original file and opening it, instead of spending hours importing/transcoding and taking up gobs more disk space too.As a result I am seriously considering dual-booting Windows 7 on my MBP so I can import and edit AVCHD video clips (by copying the .MTS files, not by importing into iMovie libraries in AIC).Consider that I switched to Apple computers over 7 years agobecauseof how deftly they handled DV video over Firewire compared to their PC counterparts.  I really feel the tables have been turned here. I really hope to see some improvement -- and soon!I bought Adobe P. Elements 9 for that very reason. The ability to edit AVCHD natively.I also have FCE. If I need Blue-Ray I just export my project to AP Elements!</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byneuropsychguyIt's not fair to compare the &quot;free&quot; iMovie to Premiere. At least compare Final Cut Express (which does support AVCHD) to Premiere (or, FCP to Premiere). Should Apple include AVCHD support in iMovie? Just purchase a copy of Final Cut Express. I'm assuming you'd have to purchase Win 7 and Premiere if you wanted to do the same thing on a dual booted Mac. FCE would be cheaper (unless you happen to get the OS and software for free from a university/work agreement with Microsoft and Adobe).Your post gave me hope, until I read thisMacWorld review, which says:&quot;Part of the reason for queuing material is that Final Cut Expressdoes not import the AVCHD footage natively. As with HDV footage,AVCHD is transcoded to Apple Intermediate Codec (AIC)for editing within the program; this is the same behavior you&#8217;d see in Movie &#8217;08 and Final Cut Pro 6. ... The transcoding step does add time to the ingest process. For a simple example, a one-minute clip took 1:34 to ingest on my 2.33GHz MacBook Pro; ingesting several clips totaling around six minutes in duration took 6:27.  ... Incidentally, Final Cut Expresswill not transcode the native .MTS filesdirectly; it needs to take the footagefrom the camcorder. However, a $30 utility called Voltaic can do the job outside Final Cut Express ...&quot;Sigh.</text>

You can only read the book using the Kindle or a Kindle app Amazon wrote for an approved device.-Steam is pretty good, but it has MORE restrictions then anything Apple.  Your games have to connect to the mothership and report your use, they automatically upgrade themselves without asking your permission, they add and remote features as they wish to completely off-line only games.  In at lest one case they completely moved an &quot;adult content mode&quot; from a game people already had installed.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byWinniSteve Jobs is so full of ****, it's unbelievable. BluRay is a &quot;bag of hurt&quot; because of its DRM restrictions? Then what are Apple's iGadgets and the DRM-infested iTunes (movie) content that he is selling? Mountains of hurt?I've never experienced more hurtful DRM crap than the stuff that Apple is selling. At the moment, there are only two companies on the market that sell DRMed product that don't make me feel abused and cheated: Amazon with their Kindle store and Valve with their Steam store.In my experience, Apple is the most abusive company when it comes to DRM, so maybe His Steveness should just shut the **** up. The only reason why he does not want to sell Macs with BluRay players is that he is afraid that this would cut into their iTunes sales. Who needs expensive, DRM-infested and inferior quality movie downloads when you can have better quality on a physical medium for the same price? Right: Nobody. That's why you won't ever see a Mac with a BluRay drive.I love your post, you're spot on about Mr Jobs' stance on Blu-ray, he can call it a 'bag of hurt' all he wants but every time he says that it just makes me laugh. His lack of support for it is nothing more than a desire to protect iTunes downloads, partly because they are lining his pockets, and partly because he sees digital downloads as the future. I'm sure he's right in the long-term, but at the moment a lot of people don't have good enough internet to stream or download HD content quickly, particularly outside the USA.It's obvious from a commercial standpoint that he's doing the best thing for Apple, but I don't think he's doing the best thing for the consumer. The fact that Apple are a member of the BD board but don't fully support the technology just makes the whole situation even more hilarious and irritating.</text>

I mainly wanted to use the medium for backup.  My iTunes library alone is about 100 gb.  There's no feasible way right now to back up anything of that size, except onto another hard drive (or to span 2 dozen DVDs).  I guess I could spring for terabytes of online storage.  It's getting to a point where there's simply too much data to handle efficiently.</text>

It's getting to a point where there's simply too much data to handle efficiently.Why not a NAS?  That is what I do with my TB's of data.</text>

It's going to be a long time until the next best thing comes around....I think in a year or two DVD will be no longer used, maybe 3...but then what? Are they just going to completely pull out the drive and have it as a plug in drive, as they did with the Air? That'd be weird. They are really pushing this whole digital media thang. It just needs to be better quality</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byWiiDSmokerThis is what happens when a company want support another technology because of rivalry. We all know Jobs won't support Blu-Ray to promote iTunes. Well, I'm sorry Steve but iTunes does not offer 1080P and HD Audio. Sure some people may not need it, but it is a huge selling point and people are buying Blu-Rays.Most of the time, Blu-rays can be had for cheaper than iTunes and it comes with a digital copy and dvd.You have to remember that while I do agree with your short-term point on Blu-Ray, it is notway for a long-term prospect. I have been using the Mac OS platform for over 20 years now and I am not a fan-boy by any measure as I do not agree with many things that Steve Jobs does, however the point being is that iTunes is scalable while Blu-Ray is not.Consider that yes presently that iTunes Store only has 480p and 720p content &quot;presently&quot; available to its customers, it does not mean thattoday, tomorrow or a year plus from today cannot offer 480p, 720p, 1080p and even 2160p (Ultra High Definition) content. Unlike Blu-Ray that offers 1080p today and might be capable to offer 2160p content in the future, it is a &quot;bag-of-hurt&quot; considering codecs have to along with DRM for region. This creates a lot of lengthly processes that slows down market adoption.take on DRM was that if it did not include it, the music and movie along with the networks would not allow they content to be available on the iTunes Store, Steve would love for this content to be DRM-free as it has made efforts in the past and I am sure are still fighting the good fight to make the iTunes content less restrictive for its customers. Its the industry that wants DRM not.What I really wantiDevices to support is native avi and OGG support. I do not care if mp4 is better or not, I would like iOS to support other formats. Again not a deal breaker for me, however it would be nice forto include it (might be a licensing issue, I suspect).Scalability is the key word here, this is one of the main reasons that Steve Jobs went with intel chips due to performance = power ratio for mobile computing. This is nothing new, Steve has mentioned mobile computing and Devices as key to the future and desktops being the workhorse. Blu-Ray is a closed environment at present and I do not see anything changing in the near future. DVD, CD, SVCD, VCD, Laser Discs, VHS, BetaMax are all closed formats of history and we know where they all end up. Cloud Storage, not Cloud Computing is where things are heading.People have to change how they consume entertainment.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byerr404The root of the issue is the requirement for compliance to a secured HDPC connection despite it not providing any benefit to the end user or content owner. As of now, HDCP DRM is a complete waste of time and money and has been a failure at it's original goal of reducing piracy via analog holes.Frankly the best copy protection for Blu-Ray has always been the size of the RAW data.The Blu-Ray consortium should consider this requirement obsolete and allow players to ignore the flag for full quality playback. This would allow options for users to play back content w/o embedded OS support (increasing market share). There are already many third party Blu-Ray drives available and a Mac (and Linux) Blu-Ray media players could be written w/o OS cooperation.OSX already supports HDCP.The laptops support it through the minidisplay port and the mini even has an HDMI jack.Also, despite Job's claims, Apple isn't entirely a mobile devices company. A Mac Mini with a bluray player would be rather sweet actually and use a lot less wattage when watching movies than my current PS3. It'd be a near perfect HTPC. Additionally the 27 inch iMac's screen goes to waste without the highest resolution content possible, and even the 21 inch iMacs can benefit. Yes, it does make a difference on &quot;such a small screen&quot; since you'resitting closer to the screen than you would with a TV and are thus better able to notice the pixels.Having it as an option on laptops isn't as importantAs par benefits, perhaps it's not so much about gaining so much as keeping the ones we already have. I hate DRM just as much as anybody else since indiscriminately locking up the media in this fashion effectively kills off most applications of fair use for the afflicted media and hurts hardware compatibility/diversity. However as as Blu-ray is the media format the studios have decided upon, I'm at least partially willing to put up with any additional requirements it might impose upon OSX to preserve my interests as a customer. To me physical possession is more than just the ability to put something on the shelf, it's a proof of purchase and a form of ownership.If the future becomes downloadable content, we can all say goodbye toFirst Sale Doctrine, since DLC and the second hand market are effectively incompatible. It'd give too much censorship power to the studios, especially if we don't have control of local copies of the files, as things might happen with trusted computing platformssimilar toiOS and The Cloud. Even worse, most obscure media would be effectively lost within a generation since there'd be effectively no opportunity to rediscover the media once the original owners lost interest or died. This means no more cult classics and art made before its time, such as theMona Lisa, might not ever be appreciated at all.On another note, personally I'd prefer something other than optical media, kind of like an SDHC card since it'd resolve or minimize most of the issues such as durability and space confinement. However no such alternative exists in the movie marketplace and so long as we are using the space on an optical drive like DVD, we might as well use it for whichever optical drive is best at the moment, which just so happens to be Blu-ray. Optical media also has the benefit of being very cost effective to pass around, say if you have friend/family with a dialup/metered internet connection (they do exist, esp. in more rural areas) or if you have particularlylargefiles to send.</text>

	<text>The fact is that Blu-ray sales figures are rising steadily.  DVD sales are in regular decline.  Somewhere between 2012 and 2015 Blu-ray media sales will surpass DVD.  Once that happens expect the big boxes to shove DVDs off the shelves as quickly as they got rid of their HD-DVD inventory.And the next generation will be no different.  At some point a 4K optical disc will be introduced and will co-exist with Blu-ray for a few years before it too wins the displacement game for shelf space.There is always argument that eventually downloads will win and optical media will go away.  That is simply not possible any time soon for the same reason it is not possible now.  4K movie files will contain four times as much data as a Blu-ray disc.  Enjoy downloading a few of those with your ever increasing bandwidth caps.  A decade later 8K movie files will be four times bigger than 4K.  It goes on and on...</text>

For the Mac Pro's (and iMac's with the 27&quot; screen), higher resolution playback demands BluRay. 720p is just not it.2 things wrong with your line of thought :- My MBA is connected to an external monitor the same as the Mac Pro is in your example.  This monitor has much higher than 720p resolution and thus can benefit from the 1080p resolution.  Not to mention it is much better to watch downscaled content than upscaled content- I own Blu-ray discs.  I buy Blu-ray discs.  While I can pop a DVD in my Blu-ray player/drive with ease, the contrary doesn't work so well.  Hence why having the option on a Mac of a Blu-ray drive is a good thing, even if you're using your laptop's 720p screen, since at least you can watch the movie vs not watching it all because the damn superdrive doesn't read blu-rays.So go ahead and &quot;agree 100%&quot;, you're just being shortsighted.  If you aren't yourself interested in the option, it doesn't mean others aren't and you should never campaign against choice.</text>

I think we will finally get Cocoa and the new QuickTime X foundation.  Now, please remind me, if it is in fact Cocoa does that imply 64bit as well?That is really all I want with expanded format support for modern cameras and DSLRs and a new UI throughout the entire studio and some Shake baked into Motion!  And please stability, more stability, especially in Motion!P.S.  If they are rewriting in Cocoa anyway, wouldn't that logically spell a new UI?  Wouldn't that not be much more work since Cocoa makes up the UI?  Need some understanding here.</text>

If you did not have a cap of 120GB/mnth believe me it would not be a problem, however Bell and Rogers will try to tell you that new infrastructure cost money while playing caps on the over-priced service so that they can stuff they own services to you (on-Demand).

Usually, like DVD, they have 4 options : Play - Audio setup - Special Features - Scene Selection as the top menu and what you find under these are pretty much your standard fare.Look, maybe it's because I've played video games all my life, but navigating menus is not confusing at all, even if it's not consistent.  There's no consistency to UIs and choices in video games and people figure it out without requiring a 16 hour instructor led course.I think you're blowing the whole &quot;problem&quot; way out of proportion.</text>

Plus, I'm the IT guy at a middle school and I've see a lot of really shoddy flash drives.  Some of it may be from the 800 or so hormonally challenged 11-14 year olds, but a lot of it is also poor build quality in the flash drives.  But no technology is 100% idiot proof yet 100% usable.  Besides, make something idiot-proof &amp; someone will make a better idiot.Yeah, I wish iTunes provided all the functionality of a real DVD. Probably eventually we will no longer require physical discs to buy movies, but right now iTunes isn't perfect for movies... My parents don't speak English, and iTunes doesn't even offer additional languages or anything, not even subtitles, even if I manage to find a subtitle file on the net. For anyone who doesn't speak English, iTunes movies are completely useless.</text>

	<text>For those who think 1080p is the pinnacle of image quality then please reconsider. HD will be replaced with &quot;Ultra High Resolution&quot; (or what ever they decide to call them) meaning 4k, 8k etc resolutions. Try to download 4k res files and you soon understand that even with compression the consumer delivery files will be huge. Optical formats will be with us for long time to come. When working with files like these I have 1Gbits pipes and even then it can be pure pain to transfer the rushes.Regarding BR being &quot;bag of hurt&quot;...

	<text>Interesting discussion over at reduser on Mac pro issues.These are people most concerned with future of Mac Pro and FCP.http://reduser.net/forum/showthread.php?t=53440M MostSenior MemberNext MacPro: Predictions...There won't be a next MacPro. If I read Apple correctly, they really don't have an interest in tower configurations anymore, and they might not even have enough sales volume to justify a separate &quot;Pro&quot; computer based on it. They did, after all, recently kill the XServe for just that reason. My prediction is that the next MacPro will be the iMac - but a radically reconfigured iMac, one with a built in bus-level expansion system, perhaps based on LightPeak technology as the interconnect.This would permit Apple to manufacture one form factor, one machine, with standard internals and features, perhaps with different screen sizes, as they do now. Expansion modules would be made available by both Apple and third parties for specific industry needs: PCIe slot modules for things like GPU and special purpose video cards (often the same thing), co-processing modules for adding CPU power and/or clustering, interface modules for things like FibreChannel or 10GigE connections, video I/O modules (perhaps built by companies like AJA and Blackmagic, providing the same functionality as today's PCIe cards, but in a self contained breakout box), and plenty of other things I can't think of........SSD's are becoming faster, cheaper, and can be manufactured in smaller form factors than current hard drives, allowing for multiple drive capability in the main case via &quot;pop in&quot; slots on the side of the case, much like the current DVD slot. In short, with Apple's history of innovation and design, I think it makes complete sense that they would eliminate the traditional PC tower design, centralize manufacturing on one desktop form factor, but implement new technologies to allow that form factor to serve all markets, from basic consumers to high end professionals, without compromise....That's just my own prognostication, based on nothing other than my own observations, and with absolutely no basis in any announced actual fact. Apple has a history of throwing away the rule book when they've deemed it necessary or desirable. Hell, they even changed their entire design to a new processor, requiring a completely new motherboard design, new peripherals, and a complete rewrite of the operating system. And they did that twice. You don't get any more radical than that....</text>

Thoughsits on the Bu-Ray Board of Directors, it does not licensing it and has not included hardware decoding options. This is why there are present external hardware options however no way of viewing the Blu-Ray video content only writing data to a Blur-Ray Disc.</text>

Hence, the so called HD is not the pinnacle but its still consumer delivery resolution. Therefore HD will be replaced as consumer delivery resolution in not so distant future.Ultra High Vision (name used by some) is  already in limited consumer testing in Japan and Europe. The actual resolution is 16x of HD resolution (7680 x 4320). When you first time see 8K clips they truly look awesome and I don't mean &quot;Apple/SJ awesome&quot;. I mean &quot;its like watching a movie thats really there awesome&quot;. Do that in 3D and you have researches saying that it looks too real (and they actually did research about possible dangers of having too realistic image -&gt; 70&quot; window into alternative reality kind of thing)Regarding the current situation, if you value quality then Apple encoded HD movies can look ok and in some situations like crap. BR has much better quality (both audio and video). With BR you can achieve the intended look far more accurately then with high compression formats. To many film makers its pure torture to go down from 35mm or 4K rushes to some high compression online delivery format. Its like, &quot;you paid to see it so out of professional pride you should have the opportunity to experience and see it the way it was meant to be seen&quot;.</text>

	<text>It seems apparent at this point that the future may be non-physical media across the board.1. iPod: helped bring digital music to the forefront (along with other digital media player manufacturers). Many ripped their CD's, ditched them and now purchase much of their music digitally online.2. iPhone: iOS introduced the Apple App Store, failitiating production, marketing, sales and utilization of applications on a broad scale. From games to business applications, the iPhone/iPad/iOS HELPED introduce digital mobile applications to a wider consumer base (iOS/Apple are not the only companies with mobile applications but Apple has been the most successful)3. Movies/TV Shows: After establishing a strong digital media presence with music and applications, visual media made its presence into the ITMS. ISPs have made strides in bandwidth availability/speed over the past few years, facilitating the access to larger sized media.4. Mac OS X App Store: in its infancy, applications may be limited in size and suites such as iWork/Adobe CS may split their applications to make smaller applications more accessible for download, enticing more buyers that need one program such as Photoshop. Apple has worked at sreamlining their software to decrease its footprint iimprove overall functionality (Leopard to Snow Leopard). As ISPs such as Verizon FiOS continue to improve data speeds, soon improved bandwidth will allow larger files to be easily accessible (14.4k to ~4-5 Mbps demonstrates that technology will evolve eventually with content).Many laugh at Apple's commitment to environmental awareness. I challenge any of you to travel to Haiti, China, or any third world nation in which our electronic waste is disposed. Witness first hand how much our consumption of electronics is polluting lands and water tables, leading to disease. Our need for speed and convenience resulting in disposable electronics is at a cost we don't see. Plastics, mercury, arsenic, etc all go somewhere. Apple has shifted their products from plastic casings and screens to recyclable aluminum, arsenic and mercury free glass displays, LED LCDs and are pushing for less physical media.DRM free digital music is now available and now you can share your music using AirPlay, allowing others to play their music/movies at a friends via their wifi. It's also easy to strip DRM from music contentWhy not push for programs that are easily downloaded?1. Digital media would save companies money in product design and packaging, factories for DVD printing, shipping, and marketing.2. Increasing consumer awareness and accessibility by suggesting an alternative program would broaden consumer availability and sales. Consumers would save time and money from purchasing directly from your home/office.3. Online media is much easier to maintain than physical media. Installing applications from the DVD and maintaining a software library of DVDs, serial numbers, boxes, etc is a tedious task. Some companies require original DVDs in order to upgrade to the latest version (File Maker requires all previous versions/DVDs, my clients have 3-4 versions as they need to install one on top of the other for the upgrade pricing). Keeping a purchase record instead of countless DVDs would remedy the issue, requiring the purchaser a one time download and copy.4. Program backups. Many complain about the potential for maintaining a digital application library. As hard drives have become larger and cheaper, it doesn't require much space to hold the data. One SATA bay holds my media: music, movies, applications for the ITMS and all my programs for OS X and Windows. When a program is updated, I simply delete the older version and replace it with the new one. I keep my purchase receipts on MobileMe and backed up with Time Machine. I back up my data with time machine and with my purchase receipts saved on the cloud and a printed record filed away. Should I need to I can contact the company and have the program easily accessible for download.This is not a simple topic and there are Pro's and Con's so forgive my long email but I wanted to address everything at once. While movies online do not beat 1080P Blu-Ray media and I would LOVE Apple to incorporate Blu-Ray media into OS X, at some point compression and programming coupled with improved bandwidth would make even Blu-Ray media unnecessary.</text>

	<text>No Blu-Ray on Apple devices because Apple wants to push you to get your HD content from iTunes. Simple as that. It has nothing to do with DRM, which can easily be added to OS X. If you can use Blu-Ray drives under Windows then the DRM is not an insurmountable thing.The other aspect is that you cannot currently get subtitles or captions on movies bought or streamed over the internet from iTunes, Netflix or any other provider. This is a major issue for people in the deaf community who are completely left out of this new technology. For them, DVDs are still required.</text>

Bluray is now the standard...standalone players are less than $60.DVD is still sold but you have to be stupid to buy a DVD player when you can get a bluray player and you have a HDTV. bluray quality is way better than any other format.That said....There is no reason why Apple should support bluray...they are a disc less company...look at the the Macbook Air and the Ipad......they are on the right path for them.There is no point in supporting bluray...but they need to support all the codecs that bluray supports....especially the AVCHD format.</text>

	<text>I'll never understand how the iTunes store does so well when the studios and labels only allow Apple to offer poor quality movies/tv shows/music at a price that is often higher than in stores/amazon.I recently grabbed the complete Sopranos DVD box set for £50, iTunes store would cost over £180 and be of lesser quality without any extras. Likewise the X-Men complete box set on Blu-Ray was cheaper than the iTunes SD versions. I know that convenience can be king, but if you have a decent TV and surround system it's wasted buying anything from the iTunes store. I've never even purchased a song from iTunes because unless it's lossless I'd be putting my decent speakers to waste.I'm sure that digital distribution is the future, but until it can give me the same or similar quality as optical media at a similar price I can wait. The odd thing is that I now buy all my games from Steam (all the games will be exactly the same as the boxed versions more or less), which seems to offer a service tailored to the user rather than the content creators. If I can buy GTA4 (weighing in at over 30 Gig) for £6.49 and download it to as many computers as I own, and/or back it up to an external HD/DVDs to instal on any other computer why can't the studios/labels allow Apple and other digital distributors to do the same, my only guess is greed.I also agree with those that think that the Blu-Ray bag of hurt is Steve Jobs not wanting it on his platform as it may hurt iTunes sales, and stop people from being locked into the platform, because if Steve Jobs is so against Blu-Ray why doesn't he use his influence at Disney to stop all their films being released on Blu-Ray (often with a DVD and digital version included)? After all if Blu-Ray is so bad for Apple why is it alright for Disney and Pixar?</text>

Apple will either release an alternative or render the issue totally moot via a different method. Trust that they've got something in the works. Their new $302 billion market cap allows them a lot of room to move.You're right about the executive entrance.  But it's a weak argument.  Those executive Macbooks still need to be reimaged.As for the &quot;Live with it&quot; comment; sorry, but screw you and Apple for that attitude.  I'm the one with fifteen hundred Macs that have to be imaged, updated, require directory services, etc...  And I'm the one supporting those in an organization that isn't willing to extend AD to cover the loss of OD -- as they'd rather just pull the plug on the Macs altogether and get on with far more reasonably priced Dells.Which is precisely what I've told our App reps.  You want &quot;live with it&quot;?  Here's a live with it: I'm done championing Apple in meetings only to have the same company screw those that actually work to support the users and machines.  At this point, I'm migrating all (read ALL) Apple related services to other platforms (SUS and Netbooting to *BSD, our management platform to Linux and OD to vanilla OpenLDAP).  What isn't able to migrate (Podcast Producer, FC Server) is getting cut.  There will not be a single Mac Mini Server or Mac Pro Server purchased to reward Apple for their very generous three month warning.  I've got better things to do than spend my day patching their annoyance over enterprise needs.Apple may indeed have big plans for the future, but they've seriously burned bridges with those that REQUIRE enterprise level solutions and have to plan accordingly.  My boss and his boss now know that Apple simply does not bring trustworthiness to the table.  Apple could show up tomorrow with whatever solution they want; I'LL have no part of it.  I simply cannot trust that it'll last more than a fiscal year or not wind up EOL'd as soon as the check clears.They love selling Macs and iOS devices to our schools; but they have no interest in providing the actual tools needed to deploy and maintain them, nor guaranteeing they'll be there for us  -- which is why we've only got 1500 Apple logos compared to 14k Dell logos.And at this point, I fully support the notion of reconsidering our refresh plans.Quote:Originally Posted byKnightWRXI have cable.  30 mbit cable.  With a 120 GB cap.  It also costs over 70$ per month.  Right now, BD is my best source for quality.Exactly, thank you.  People seem to forget that there's about to be an end to the broadband smorgasbord.You want a bag of hurt?    Your wallet is going to feel it the first time you get slapped with 250-500 GB overage because of all the iTunes, Netflix Steam and Hulu streaming.  And that's being conservative.Proof?  I logged 350 GB alone in December and that was all Netflix, a handful of Steam purchases and VPN.Think of the household with five people with their own desktops, laptops, iPads, PS3's, Xboxes  streaming whatever, whenever.  I'm predicting a physical media renaissance in the next year or so...</text>

Steam is just too damn convenient.I agree with you.  I haven't bought physical media in *years*.  Awhile back I ripped all the CDs and DVDs I had and said that was it.  The system isn't perfect yet, but with Amazon (iirc when you buy movies or music amazon remembers), Netflix, and OnDemand I've never had any problem finding the content I want to watch.Selection for NF streaming isn't a technical problem, but a studio one.  The studios want consumers to buy media because it continues their 'buy the same content in a new format' scam.When it comes to streaming quality, it's only improving.  Going from 720p to 1080p isn't like going from VHS to DVD or even DVD to HD.  There comes a time when for most people it's 'good enough' and convenience wins out.  Of course there will always be the 'geeks' who have 100&quot;+ TVs and 8.1 surround that require BR or whatever format is hot (remember laserdisc!), but they will remain the minority.</text>

In a world without physical media, how do you propose I do this?The file's too big to email.It's not necessarily something I want to make public, so no YouTube (1.5 hours is too long for YouTube anyway).So do I send him a thumb drive?  Set up my own streaming media server?  Seed a torrent? What's more convenient than burning a little DVD (or Blu-Ray, or whatever comes down the line) and sending a packet in the mail?</text>

If I read Apple correctly, they really don't have an interest in tower configurations anymore, and they might not even have enough sales volume to justify a separate &quot;Pro&quot; computer based on it. They did, after all, recently kill the XServe for just that reason. My prediction is that the next MacPro will be the iMac - but a radically reconfigured iMac, one with a built in bus-level expansion system, perhaps based on LightPeak technology as the interconnect...I'll up the ante.  I predict that 10.7 will be the last pure OS X client OS and that new &quot;Macs&quot; will be hybridized OS X/iOS MBAs as of 2013 (Suggesting that Lion has a two year lifespan).You'll have iPhones and iPads for your 'up to 10&quot;' needs and Airs specced out at 11&quot;, 13&quot; and possibly a 15&quot; &quot;workhorse&quot; model.Apple's focus for the future is consumer model spending, not content creation -- and I'd wager that they will do very, very well with that.The &quot;old school&quot; crowd (like myself) will get annoyed and migrate back to *nix, over/back to Windows or (in my case) away from IT altogether.  For the record, I love my iPad and I'm curious to see where it goes from here, but I'm pretty vocal about my belief that Apple's interest in &quot;Computers&quot; is over.Steve liked the Mac over the Apple II line, he liked NeXT for developers, not users (just look at the pricing if you need proof); and he's going to like more robust iOS devices over current computers that let people &quot;tinker&quot;.Appliances and media consumption devices are very lucrative.</text>

Glad I sold my Mac pro while I could get something for it. Moved on.As for blu ray, don't think apple will ever allow it. They would rather stream all content and ream us all. But seems like all companies are going to streaming. As what was posted earlier, broadband prices will rise and caps will be utilized to ream us more.

HD will be replaced with &quot;Ultra High Resolution&quot; (or what ever they decide to call them) meaning 4k, 8k etc resolutions. Try to download 4k res files and you soon understand that even with compression the consumer delivery files will be huge. Optical formats will be with us for long time to come. When working with files like these I have 1Gbits pipes and even then it can be pure pain to transfer the rushes.Regarding BR being &quot;bag of hurt&quot;... Maybe for those who can't even a make decent code for alarm clock...I disagree.  At a certain threshold, the bulk of the market stops caring about &quot;quality&quot; beyond a certain point.  Consider .mp3 supplanting cd's and the complete failure of all the &quot;super&quot; audio formats.  Even with HD video, I would argue that approx 10%-20% of the buyers of HDTV's are driven by HD content (the bulk of that football nerds and Star Wars nerds I bet), while the rest are driven by the fact that the tv is &quot;bigger&quot;, &quot;better&quot;, and most of all &quot;thinner&quot;.  You're giving the typical consumer way too much credit.  Sure, there will be the 5% and 10% of the media buying public who want ultra ultra high quality, but for most people, DVD quality on a decent LCD/Plasma screen is all they want.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byarchipellagoI work in city with free wi-fiI have 15meg unlimited ADSL at home for £7.50   ($12) a month.I stand by the first line of my first reply to you.So I guessshould have never went with USB 1.0 with the original Bondi Blue iMac G3.By your logic they should have stuck with whatever was already popular or established in the consumer market then to adopt USB.I also see thatis spending millions if not billions on a new data facility, just so they can put in a Blu-Ray drive on they hardware and screw scalability of 480p/720p/1080p/etc... so they can stick with whatever Sony decides to do with Blu-Ray.You are forgetting something in your analogy, consumers buy what is affordable, guess what if Blu-Ray today were not affordable it would not be alive. Here is food for thought,can offer whatever content is available on iTunes Store in any resolution they want and offer promotions or deals for the end consumer.Think about this, you buy a DVD movie title in 1999 and 8 years down the road that movie title is on Blu-Ray 720p then in another year its offered again as a 1080p title. So given that you might have spent 15 pounds for the original title back in 1999 and now want the same title offered on Blu-Ray 8 years later (however you are not aware that the studio will release a 1080p version a year later) you would have spent possible another 15 pounds for the 720p version and maybe another 10-15 pounds again on the 1080p version.So consider this you have 3 physical copies of the same movie title one on DVD, one on Blu-Ray 720p and another on Blu-Ray 1080p.You would have spent possible 40-45 pounds on that one movie title. Now if there is newer technology such as Ultra High-Def with makes 720p and 1080p look like a postage stamp you will shell out even more for that same title. While iTunes Store can either offer you the higher definition for free or for a discounted price.iTunes Store is about buying titles, not the actual content. Yes, the iTunes Store resolution is nothing close to 1080p, however you are forgetting that its scalable, something physical media cannot do. You can only go with 1080p and downsize, going with 480p and upsizing to 1080p will not render great results. On the other hand if the title is digital it can be offered and viewed in any format even for a mobile phone screen, where as a Blu-Ray will require it to be ripped, encoded and decoded for any mobile device.Your comments are short-sighted.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bynotjustjayThanks for the suggestions.  You're right, I was trying to get this off my plate as quickly as possible, and I acknowledge that my machine was not optimized for the process (older laptop, internal drive and pressed for free disk space -- in fact I spent an hour offloading files from my HD onto my NAS in order to make room for the editing I was about to do).Sounds like my solutions are:(a) Use Toast(b) Use Adobe PremiereI notice that neither solution uses Apple-native solutions. Both solutions will involve spending money on software (granted Toast isn't that expensive).   &quot;Upgrade to a faster machine&quot; is also implicit. This is what I think is kind of sad. I won't post my entire &quot;why I switched to Mac&quot; story here, but the gist of it was that, at the time, I was struggling to edit DV video with my top-of-the-line, spec'ed out Dell workstation laptop running pro NLE software, but my friend had a several-years-older Titanium PowerBook G4 that ran circles around my machine.  He imported, edited, did full-screen preview playback, etc. without rendering (well, iMovie was doing background transition rendering) and without skipping frames like my Windows machine did.  All using the FREE built-in iLife software.  That impressed me so much that I bought my own PowerBook a few months later.  It's not that his machine was faster (in fact, I'm certain it wasn't) but Apple tuned their softwarejust sousing techniques like background rendering to make itfeelfaster.I want to point out here that I'm not a pro (though I dabbled with semi-pro projects for a while). I don't really want to set up an editing workstation. I'm just an average guy with a Mac laptop trying to make a DVD of a concert he recorded on an HD camera.  Sounds like the kind of typical common task that Apple used to make really easy and elegant.I wish AVCHD was a native edit option in Final Cut and iMovie too, but Apple does at least have a reason for not offering it that you might not be aware of.  It is a highly-compressed codec, Long-GOP meaning that not every frame of video is a full frame, so the system is CONSTANTLY having to calculate frames, even just to play the video back on your screen.  It is VERY CPU-intensive to work with these codecs, especially to edit them and render them natively!  You think your machine feels slow now?  Try editing native Long-GOP H.264!  Heck, even editing Long-GOP MPEG-2 is a ROYAL PITA, and that's a significantly less processor-intensive codec to work with than H.264.  Apple forcing you to transcode to an all I-frame codec like AIC (or ProRes in Final Cut) is really not that bad a solution.  Hopefully the new Final Cut will make that transcoding process MUCH faster.  ANd maybe allow native editing as well, we'll see.</text>

	<text>Lack of blu-ray would be more tolerable if Apple actually had a good alternative. The fact is that the content, pricing and general accessibility of streaming is just not there.The jealousy content providers have for Apple pushes them to punish consumers with outrageous prices and DRM restrictions. Ultimately this only feeds piracy. Apple are also partly to blame, having yet to create a compelling hardware/software solution that enables the masses to watch iTunes (and non-iTunes!) content on their TVs.For shame!Blu-Ray's DRM is a ridiculous pain in the ass, and I really believe that streaming is the future... however the format is too big to ignore. Apple should continue bitch about its flaws, but they also need to swallow the **** sandwich and make it a BTO option.</text>

According to the report's sources, there continues to be substantial turmoil over the imminentdiscontinuationof Apple's rackmountable server line due topoor sales.  A number of high-profile users, including Apple director and former Genentech chairman Art Levinson, have reportedly complained about the discontinuation, and whileHardmacindicates that &quot;this storm is maybe not over&quot;, it is unclear if Apple is contemplating some alternative to canceling the Xserve line.With regards to Blu-ray, sources indicate that Jobs still considers the technology to be a&quot;bag of hurt&quot;, with DRM restrictions and licensing issues that make the format unattractive.  According to the report, Jobs noted during a recent internal meeting that he is &quot;ashamed&quot; that Apple's name is associated with the Blu-ray format through its position as a member of the Blu-ray Disc Association's board of directors, a role it has heldsince 2005.Article Link:Final Cut Updates in March or April?

	<text>When the article mentions DRM or RDM or whatever restrictions does that mean blu ray movies have high restrictions on being copied to a computer? If so, I'd like to argue that many blu ray movies include a separate regular DVD with a playable movie or a file to download to itunes. And I think this is great because you can then put the movie on your ipod or iphone and take it where ever you go. I think all the movie companies should include this with their blu rays.Also, does anybody, but me, think that it's crazy that the iphone and ipod touch both have TWO HD cameras but Mac is still stuck with the old isight? That is definitely one thing they should update. They should also up the resolution on the MBPs as the MBA got the same in its update.</text>

Of course film is slowly being replaced by digital and most of the digital video cameras are HD and projectors in theaters are 2k. 2048x1080 (aka 2k) isn't that much bigger than 1920x1080.Mainly talking about digital cinematography. With Red One you normally go 4K if &lt;30 fps and if over cranked then 2K. With Epic you'll be shooting 4-5K if &lt;120fps (in general). Regarding DI it depends. Since 2007 4K pipelines have been shaping up. Regarding 8K you are absolutely correct and I hope it stays that way... Regarding projectors Sony has been pushing their 4K projectors since 2007 (CineAlta SRXR220 and SRXR320). I think it was early 2010 (or late 2009) when they made some large scale deals both in US and Europe.Quote:Originally Posted byLethalWolfeBillions of dollars have been spent in the transition from SD analog to digital and HD.

However, for some reason there is lot of interest on &quot;hyper definition&quot; from some broadcasters. It seems its like when we got out of SD the flood gates just bursted and now you have 3D and next you are getting ready to offer over 2K while tackling with all the &quot;content management&quot; hoops.Quote:Originally Posted byLethalWolfe;11659514HDTVhas been around in one form or another for decades yet it's only been within the past 5 or 6 years that it's really taken off and that's in no small part thanks to TV manufacturers ceasing production of SD TVs.True but lets face it. Lot of it has to do with cost of HD production. With HD digital cinematography and post the costs have plummeted. Few years ago your &quot;only chance&quot; was to shoot with $500 000 kit and now you &quot;can go and shoot&quot; with some prosumer cam and get &quot;decent results&quot;. If you think about it, HDCAM was only introduced around 1998 and HDCAM SR in 2003.</text>

	<text>Like it or not, but that &quot;bag of hurt&quot; is here to stay; it's only a matter of time until Apple capitulates-- we're nowhere near getting 30-40 GB copies of movies via the iTunes store or other digital outlets.As per the Xserve, as everyone has said it's a dumb move philosophically, and could end up hurting the bottom line in the long run through perceived image for potential corporate customers. Some products are worth taking the hit over for PR and marketing alone, although I imagine the hit caused by the Xserve overhead isn't exactly staggering. It's just a dumb move in general.I doubt internal pressure will change Steve's mind, however.</text>

	<text>I think the important point in this blu-ray debate is that Apple are right in claiming that the future is digital downloads and streaming, but that is where the problem lies: it's the future and not the present. Blu-ray isn't going anywhere in the near future, and is currently the best way to easily and reliably watch HD content.The major problem for download and streaming of HD content is that it requires quite a lot of bandwidth and a powerful broadband connection. At the moment, the vast majority of internet users don't have that connection available. The most popular broadband (in the UK at least) is 8mb, and that simply isn't good enough to stream 1080p content. Until broadband connections improve and 20 and 50mbps connections are available to many people at a reasonable monthly rate, digital content will not be the best or most popular solution.As things stand at this point in time, Apple fail by not supporting blu-ray. I'm sure in 10 years time we will all agree with Jobs' stance on optical media, but at the moment he is plain wrong.</text>

	<text>If there is another format in a couple years then I am plain out done buying movies ever again.  I'll just rent I guess.If Jobs seriously thinks that not putting a BRD in his PC's so iTunes gets more sales then he is being ignorant.  If a person wants Blu Ray it isn't very expensive anymore to get.  I honestly can't see anyone just throwing their hands up and buying sh** off iTunes because their Mac doesn't have Blu Ray, that's plain silly.Hope the FC update is awesome, its very needed.  Taking awhile as well, and Jobs calls Adobe lazy.</text>

Watch it at home, take it to a friends house to watch, watch it on my Win 7 rig, all in glorious quality. If I'm so inclined I could rip it and create a digital copy to play on a PS3, 360, mac, PC, PSP, iPod, iPhone et-al. When iTunes and other digital distribution channels allow me a similar service I'll start using them, until then I personally will stick with the anti-consumer optical route that actually allows me more freedom with the content I've purchased.Also I asked earlier, if Steve Jobs thinks Blu-Ray is so bad why doesn't he get Disney/Pixar to only offer movies on iTunes, after all he must have a big say with all the shares he has?</text>

If NO consumer PC could handle AVCHD editing natively without some intermediate codec, I wouldn't have an issue.  However, Windows software seems to get along just fine. (Actually, so can my Mac - when I play the .MTS files using VLC.)  My friend's Windows 7 machine was able to scrub the timeline without too much stuttering. I'm pretty sure his machine isn't absolutely spanking new...AVCHD has been around for a few years now, and even though my own MBP is from 2007 and might not be able to handle the CPU load, surely the Mac Pro you buy from the Apple Store today can handle native AVCHD editing fine -- as long as the software lets you do it.  The problem is it doesn't!  (Well, not from Apple, anyway.)The other part of the problem is this weird insistence that I can't use the .MTS files individually, but they have to be &quot;imported&quot; as part of a memory card volume.  Other editors don't have this limitation.  Even if I accept the intermediary AIC, it is annoying to have to deal with importing entire cards at once and making fake-volume files in order to archive the original AVCHD footage. The MacWorld review I quoted a few pages back lists a $30 utility that can work around this issue.  It is annoying that Apple, who used to be the King of software video editing, requires me to buy third party software and $30 utilities to accomplish what should be doable right out of the box, either &quot;free&quot; with iLife, or as part of their &quot;pro&quot; software editing suites.</text>

	<text>oh and those digital copies??? yeah they expire and once locked into whatever player you entered the code into, its locked to that ecosystem too... talk about more controlohh and you can rip blu-ray to macs too.. in fact funny thing, i had a ext bluray player that OSX never had a problem detecting and showing me every file of the bluray when it was connected....the issue is just playback correct? osx can still burn to bluray discs if you have a burner? right?? and those still arent cheap...so if thats the case, then the issue boils down to a playback issue right? and like others said.. if you're going to be a blu-ray snob and go all out in your compressed 1080 glory.. you arent spending money on a 40+&quot; 1080p tv and 7.1 audio system to play it on your freaking desktop or laptop!so now i see even less of a problem</text>

It is a highly-compressed codec, Long-GOP meaning that not every frame of video is a full frame, so the system is CONSTANTLY having to calculate frames, even just to play the video back on your screen.  It is VERY CPU-intensive to work with these codecs, especially to edit them and render them natively!  You think your machine feels slow now?  Try editing native Long-GOP H.264!  Heck, even editing Long-GOP MPEG-2 is a ROYAL PITA, and that's a significantly less processor-intensive codec to work with than H.264.  Apple forcing you to transcode to an all I-frame codec like AIC (or ProRes in Final Cut) is really not that bad a solution.  Hopefully the new Final Cut will make that transcoding process MUCH faster.  ANd maybe allow native editing as well, we'll see.Sure, AIC and ProRes is easier to edit with but with any transcoding there is loss of the original video. I can see a big difference between edited AVCHD into one of these formats vs original footage.  Blu ray players are in many homes now. I would like to edit natively and burn to disk to share (if I were still using a Mac to edit) which is why I dumped apple and went back to PC to do this. I'm sure allot more folks are doing the same thing. Time for apple to get off their high horse and provide what customers want. They will be willing to pay the extra fee for this instead of the additional steps required to do this on a Mac.</text>

Unfortunately I really cannot see that happening within the next 5 to 10 years if that, as I can't see the studios and hardware manufacturers agreeing on such a solution.This is another reason that I love Steam as a platform, as long as your PC of Mac is within specification (and the game runs on mac and PC) you can play the game you bought on any system as long as you have logged in online once, after that you can play in offline mode, like I have to at the moment until the broadband is fitted in my new flat.</text>

	<text>Wow, this thread cracks me up.It's amazing that people are are okay with &quot;FairPlay&quot; DRM for video playback, but not blu-ray disc? Which format has the more restrictive DRM? Let's see here.&quot;FairPlay&quot; (iTunes) content requires HDCP for the monitor, display output, and connection. The video file can only be played on a certain number of computers, and it can only be played on Apple portable devices. You cannot lend the file to a friend nor can you sell it. You also can't take it over to a friends house unless you lug Apple hardware with you and all the appropriate adapters to connect the hardware.Blu-ray disc requires HDCP the same as iTunes for HD content. The disc can be played on any device that has a blu-ray reader. It can be played on everything from game consoles to PC blu-ray readers, to any set top blu-ray player. It can literally be played anywhere. Plus you can lend it to a friend, take just the disc and not all the hardware to a friends house, and you can sell the disc if you ever choose to.As for all the other nonsense you hear about blu-ray playback, it's just that, nonsense. I have absolutely NEVER had to update the firmware in my standalone player to play a new movie. Never. Not once. And I only ever had to update the software player in Windows ONE time to play a new movie.Blu-ray disc is truly plug and play. While you have to jump through all kinds of hoops and use proprietary hardware as well as proprietary adapters to get your iTunes content on to your TV.Then it comes down to quality. Blu-ray disc video is encoded at up to 1920x1080, up to 45Mbps H.264 or VC-1 video (only a handful of very old first generation discs used MPEG-2), with lossless or sometimes uncompressed audio. iTunes &quot;HD&quot; content? Encoded at 1280x720, slightly less than half the resolution, 4-5Mbps H.264 video (yes, about 1/10th the max bit-rate), and sub DVD quality 384Kbps Dolby Digital audio.Now let's talk about price.RedBox does individual blu-ray rentals for $1.50 per night. iTunes is $4.99. And given the file size, even on my FiOS connection, it's still faster for me to go to the local RedBox and get the blu-ray disc I want. Plus I can get that $1.50 blu-ray disc and take it over a friends house and watch it there and not have to lug my Mac, adapters, and cables along with me to watch it.For purchases, iTunes charges around $20. Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Fry's, Amazon, etc. have a ton of blu-ray discs under $20. In fact, Target and Walmart both have a section dedicated to $10 blu-ray discs. These aren't the same movies you'll find in the $5 DVD bin, but recent releases.As for sales numbers, I don't see why people keep saying &quot;DVD is outselling blu-ray disc!&quot;. For one, thats not always true. Two, people seem to forget that DVD was on the market for 7 full years before it FINALLY overtook VHS, in 2003. DVD's success was NOT overnight. Blu-ray is being adopted faster than DVD was, about twice the rate. Blu-ray disc sales set records nearly every quarter. Blu-ray disc will kill DVD at some point in the future.But online streaming? People seem to think that &quot;On Demand&quot; and online streaming services will kill blu-ray disc. Not a chance. For a few reasons. One, On Demand is expensive. Again, $5 or sometimes even $6 for a high definition movie. Same movie at RedBox with better quality is $1.50. Or if you watch a lot of movies, a Blockbuster or Netflix subscription costs the same as 3 On Demand movies. If people try to use On Demand services the way they currently watch blu-ray discs or DVDs, they'll be in for a major case of sticker shock at the end of the month when their TV bill comes and it has an extra $40-$50 tacked on.Online streaming won't kill blu-ray disc or DVD any time soon either. Why? A couple of reasons. One is quality. As myself and others have pointed out already, blu-ray disc runs at twice the resolution with up to 10x the video bit-rate of iTunes &quot;HD&quot; content. Not to mention the better audio. Even the standard definition stuff doesn't match up because theres no good way of scaling H.264 SD video to higher quality displays, while a good upscaling DVD player can easily make a DVD look better (due to lack of compression artifacting) than iTunes &quot;HD&quot; video.The second biggest reason online streaming won't kill optical media is both bandwidth and metered billing. Believe it or not, in most places around the world, metered billing (Bandwidth caps) is a way of life. ISPs here in the US drool over the thought of metered billing and several have already imposed caps. Smaller cable operators in small towns already have extremely low caps. We have yet to see how things will play out, but we'll probably see metered billing with high overages before we see online video overtake optical media. Then you'd have to factor in the cost to download plus the cost of the video. Online video would die pretty quick if you had to pay $5 for the file then another $2 for bandwidth. Plus theres actual speed. Some of us are lucky enough to live in areas that have FiOS or other high speed connections, but the recent FCC survey showed that most people are on sub-3Mbps connections. That means it would take longer to download that iTunes movie than it would to watch it. With the average blu-ray file being around 25-30Mbps, that means it could take as long as ten times as long as the movie is to download it. I don't know about you, but if I didn't have my FiOS connection, I sure wouldn't wait several hours just to download a movie. Not when I could go to RedBox and get it for a fraction of the price, or have a Blockbuster by Mail subscription that includes in-store exchanges. And the situation regarding internet service in this country isn't going to get any better since the Democrats have no spine and won't stand up for consumers stuck with a duopoly and the &quot;Party of No&quot; have enough people in Congress to stop progress.So let's summarize here:All of this nonsense about blu-ray DRM is a myth. OS X already supports HDCP. AACS and BD+ are the &quot;encryption&quot; schemes used by blu-ray disc, the same way CSS and other various forms of disc protection are used on DVD. This would be supported by the player. The same way CSS and other DVD protections have to be supported and updated in the player. blu-ray is absolutely 100% a plug and play technology for every single standalone blu-ray player and the vast majority of computers shipped over the last couple of years. Every shipping Mac supports HDCP, and every Mac with a mini DisplayPort since 2008 supports it.And most importantly, all of this nonsense regarding blu-ray licensing is also 100% fiction. Shortly after Jobs made that short sighted &quot;bag of hurt&quot; comment, the BDA made changes to licensing fees. Now its a one stop shop and one fee. Just like DVD.So, the fact that Macs support HDCP, the encryption DRM needs to be supported in the player the exact same way as DVD, and licensing is now no different than DVD means there is absolutely no reason whatsoever for Macs to not support blu-ray disc in OS X. Especially considering I can reboot into Windows on my 2008 unibody MacBook and play a blu-ray disc without issues.</text>

	<text>The real &quot;bag of hurt&quot; is the fact that a sub 1000 USD PC and a 70 USD software from Ulead offers more multimedia functionality and speed than my Mac Pro. Think about cheaply available GPU power that can be tapped properly, AVCHD editing, proper BR authoring, faster or richer Windows equivalent of the same software, and so on... This clearly isn't why I switched in 2005. Apple really got me going with this BR fiasco. I would have have never thought back in the early 90's dreaming about macs that some day I'd be owning a pro workstation from Apple and some major features are not possible on the platform. &quot;It just doesn't work&quot; or should I say it's &quot;half as amazing&quot;. For me it's mind boggling that the Macintosh lags behind so much in multimedia content creation and consumptionI have to say it's becoming more and more difficult to see a Mac Pro in my future if things keep going on like this. It doesn't help either that in Europe the quad core base model costs 3200 USD</text>

Apple, for whatever its hang up is with Blu-Ray, will likely not concede any time soon.  That does not seem to matter to consumers, because there are plenty of other reasons to buy Macs.And maybe, just maybe, Apple will be able to ride this one out.  If they keep pretending it doesn't exist, eventually it will come true, and when digital streaming downloads mature to the point where we can watch films over the internet, Apple can say &quot;See?  We were right all along.&quot;Or it could go the other way, and Apple finds itself being the only computer that can't play Blu-Ray discs.  That would be like being the only computer without a DVD capable drive back in the 2000's.  People might start complaining :P</text>

That's what nice large screen HDTVs are for and a living room are for!  Not sitting uncomfortably at my computer desk, or watching something on a small inch screen laptop, or iPad or iPhone at that! &lt;-- that to me, is ridiculous!I agree though about flash drives, as that is the route I have decided to go and take, for it's quick copying, reuse, and stability and portability and accessibility.  Sure, the largest size you can get is 64 GB, but that is sufficient enough for me, who uses it mostly as backup for all my RAW photo files, other than on my hard drive.  I also like the idea of SSD drives in computers, and is why I ultimately ended up purchasing the new 13&quot; MacBook Air (though it was between that and the 13&quot; MBP with a SSD upgrade).Though, for film projects, ability to burn to Blu-Ray would be something I would like and want.  Again though, there are external Blu-Ray burners... if they would just be compatible friendly with FC to be able to be sent and burnt to such devices.</text>

It would be nice if it would include a bluRay player but just not going to happen.As for MS DRM there is one big difference between MS and Apple in that department.  MS is very willing and will licences out their DRM to other manufactures to be able to play the content.  They could care less who makes it.Apple locks you in to their very limited use stuff.  MS on the other hand opens it up to a much larger place.  iTunes could play MS DRM providing Apple would be willing to licences it.  Apple only wants to use Apple stuff and lock you in and lock everyone out.I hate the DRM on DVD but I am getting better at stripping it so I can scream the files off my computer to my 360.</text>

And I believe that I have a decent (by US standards) broadband which is claimed to be 20Mbps but in reality varies from 10 to 15 Mbps.I see a lot more artifacts on my HD cable than I do streaming NF.  I do have a consistent 23Mb/s internet connection though.  Now that I think about it, with the compression that the satellite and cable providers use in order to squeeze in more channels they could inadvertently be training people to think NF streaming quality is good enough.  I would bet the average person already thinks it's good enough.  The benefits of instant on are a big draw.I've seen BR on my TV model and sure it looks better, but it doesn't look good enough for me change from NF streaming or just playing rented DVDs upscaled on my xbox360.The only way I see myself buying physical movies again is if I build a theater in the basement with 100&quot;+ HD projector.</text>

I doubt RED One is used on more productions than everyone else combined.Quote:I know and I do think its finically insane. However, for some reason there is lot of interest on &quot;hyper definition&quot; from some broadcasters. It seems its like when we got out of SD the flood gates just bursted and now you have 3D and next you are getting ready to offer over 2K while tackling with all the &quot;content management&quot; hoops.3D is more bark than bite IMO and while I know the TV makers will always try and find new ways to get people to buy sets I don't think they can outrun the technological hurdles of the broadcast industry (bandwidth limitations, old satellites designed to handle only MPEG-2, etc.,).  I honestly don't think we'll see another major viewing quality 'upgrade' until IPTV becomes the norm and everyone's TV is basically a screen w/a built in HTPC.  Of course trying to do things over the internet has it's own set of problems as well.Quote:Originally Posted bybearcatrpSure, AIC and ProRes is easier to edit with but with any transcoding there is loss of the original video. I can see a big difference between edited AVCHD into one of these formats vs original footage.If you can see a difference, especially a big difference, between the original and the ProRes transcode something has gone very, very wrong during the transcode.Quote:Originally Posted by*LTD*Why is Blu Ray *still* a topic of discussion?

	<text>i still wonder people care more about the quality of the bluray movies .unless you will get an eyesore on watching 720p movies .i don't see any real benefit of watching 1080p vs 720p movies , they look the same to most people using laptops to watch movies .if you want to watch HD movies on your 50&quot; screen , bluray player is a better choice .are we still talking about bluray on macs or blurays in general?</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byNuviI remember when BBC went big on Final Cut Pro and even had high quality but low cost (compared to DigiBeta) cam co-developped with JVC for that workflow. Now its iToys... Anyway, if want to play it safe go with Avid MC. Its one thing you can rely on. The latest one has been made so that FCP editors can adapt to it easily.That's an easy thing to say if you're a one man shop, but if you're a freelancer that works with multiple producers, you're tied to what they use.  In my particular case, that means FCP.There's no question Apple has some catching up to do, but they're only one update from matching or exceeding the gains that Adobe has made.  Don't forget that AVID isn't 64 bit either, and very likely won't get there before Final Cut.Unfortunately, Final Cut's development has been tied to OSX and Quicktime restrictions.  So until those issues are sorted out, Final Cut can only progress so far.  Looking at the original article, this is apparent.  Though we'll see an update in Mar/Apr, these will likely be UI and feature based; leaving the move to full 64bit and nonQT formats until Lion makes them possible.And I have nothing against AVID, I worked on it for the first 5 years of my career, they aren't invulnerable.  The last 10 years has seen their user base splinter and shrink- they haven't had a profitable quarter in years.  While Apple and Adobe can use their broader business to subsidize their Pro Video Apps, AVID MC is a one trick pony.  So conceivably, if Apple and/or Adobe, Sony Vegas, etc. continue to erode their user base, it won't matter that they're still the most used platform in high end feature and tv- because you can only run an unprofitable business for so long...</text>

	<text>I want a few things from Final Cut Studio:(1) Final Cut 64-bit Cocoa app that leverages Quicktime-X and is Multi-Core/Thread aware via Grand Central and even Open CL.  If Apple does just this, the problem will fly.  Currently FCP is bloated and slow using the exact same footage when compared to Avid.  HUGE problem.(2) Interface Redesign - The look is old, and the menu system is complicated.  It needs some serious attention.(3) Media Management - a major request from many...hopefully Apple finally addresses it.(4) Native AVCHD Editing - I know it is taxing on machines, but I have a quad core i7 iMac.  It will handle it fine.  It is ridiculous that this is not an option at least (should come to iMovie too).  It would help with file size, as well as data rates.(5) iTunes Extra / LP Authoring - Since Apple is pushing this, it would be nice to be able to create this via a neat program.(6) Full Blu-Ray Authoring...HA!  Not coming, even though it should.  I agree with Jobs, but the reality is that Blu-Ray is here to stay for a while.  Apple should adopt it.</text>

It has never mattered when it comes to Apple products, nor will it matter in the future. Same as Flash.Sales of blu-ray players and blu-ray discs tell a completely different story. Blu-ray is being adopted faster than DVD was. Blu-ray disc sales set records nearly every quarter. Blu-ray players sell in the tens of millions every year now. Blu-ray will supplant DVD and be the dominant format.On the topic of blu-ray disc's success, Apple is basically playing the child putting their fingers in their ears and saying &quot;lalala I'm not listening&quot;.Quote:Not sitting uncomfortably at my computer desk, or watching something on a small inch screen laptop, or iPad or iPhone at that! &lt;-- that to me, is ridiculous!Some people do travel and want entertainment with them.Some people live in dorms or small apartments where their large computer monitor is their primary display.Quote:I've seen BR on my TV model and sure it looks better, but it doesn't look good enough for me change from NF streaming or just playing rented DVDs upscaled on my xbox360.Blu-ray is night and day difference compared to DVD on any high definition display. It looks significantly better on everything from my 13.3&quot; MacBook display to my 24&quot; desktop monitor to larger HDTVs. Knowing what sort of quality I would be missing out on, theres no reason to stick to DVDs or Netflix poor streaming library. I wish Netflix still offered plans with no streaming. The library is terrible and the quality is even worse.Quote:Blu Ray is simply a higher capacity optical disc that is at best an in between technology.

It does a great job of taking money from the uneducated.The uneducated? Please enlightenment as to how a 720p 4-5Mbps H.264 video from iTunes with sub-DVD quality audio is somehow better than blu-ray disc, with double the resolution, 10x the video bit-rate, and lossless or uncompressed audio. Please enlightenment as to how its better to spend more time downloading a file from iTunes that can only be played on Apple software or hardware is better than spending 5 minutes driving to the closest RedBox kiosk and spending a fraction of the money on a blu-ray disc? Please enlightenment as to how its better to &quot;buy&quot; a video from iTunes that costs more than a blu-ray disc, has significantly lower quality than a blu-ray disc, and can only be played on Apple software or hardware while the blu-ray disc can be played virtually anywhere?Quote:While your at it, its time to change the bluray, go on, get off the couch and sort through the mountain of discs you own to find what you want to watch. oh and want to see the latest movie, better get off down to the store to get it. want to take a few movies with you on holiday, hope youve got a big suitcase, oh and take your blu ray player cause its region specific&hellip;.Because its so hard to get off the couch and look through discs? Seriously? It's such an inconvenience for you to get up?Again, let's go back to the issue of quality. Blu-ray discs already use the same compression that iTunes uses. So you can't use the argument of just applying more or better compression to the video. If more compression is applied then quality is lost.While you're sitting on your couch waiting for that newest movie to download, I've already driven to the store, bought the disc, came home, opened it, and started watching it. I have FiOS at home currently and get a steady 20Mbps down. Even for iTunes low quality downloads, that still means 30-40 minutes of download. I can go to Best Buy, Walmart, Target, etc. all in that amount of time and buy the higher quality copy and be home watching it before the download is complete. Or I can rent the blu-ray disc for $1.50 at RedBox.Streaming? No thanks. Quality is awful. And the library of the two biggest sources so far, Hulu and Netflix, isn't worth paying for. I'd rather have Netflix or Blockbuster send me the blu-ray disc of the previous season TV show than watch it streaming.I'm certainly not going to spend $5 or $6 for &quot;On Demand&quot; either, when there are literally 4 RedBox kiosks within a 5 minute round trip of my house.Quote:The future is digital files/ streaming etc. it always has been and always will beMaybe the distant future. But immediate future? Even the next decade? Not likely. Why? Internet service provider speeds just can't keep up with the bandwidth requirements to provide blu-ray quality video. Plus, nearly every ISP these days has video services they have a great interest in seeing succeed. They'd rather you use those, so what does that mean? Speeds won't advance the way they should, plus we're seeing ISPs cap usage. For instance, Charter started enforcing their caps and put a new cap on their top tier. Cablevision has caps depending on who they compete with. If you live in an area that competes with FiOS then they have no cap. If you live in an area that competes with DSL, you can bet they have caps. Look at Time Warner too. Thanks to consumer backlash regarding their low cap high overage trials, they basically canceled all DOCSIS 3.0 upgrades in areas that don't compete with FiOS. I forget who it was exactly at Time Warner, but he got all whiney and said because consumers wouldn't accept their low caps (40-60GB) and high overages ($1+ per GB) that they &quot;couldn't afford&quot; to upgrade their systems. Even though their quarterly earnings show record profits that continue to increase.Thats not going to change unless the government steps in. But you can bet that we'll first see low caps and high overages like AT&amp;T and Time Warner tried to introduce a couple of years ago. That will kill internet video as we know it today. The only way things will change, in the US at least, is if people can stand up and make the Democrats finally grow a spine and tell the &quot;Party of No&quot; that they better become the &quot;Party of Yes&quot; and end the government sanctioned duopolies of cable and telephone companies.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byAxemantitanAll of a sudden, I wish that HD-DVD had won the format wars.Why? Basically, what the person was saying that you quoted was wrong.HD DVD and blu-ray disc use the same DRM. HDCP, already supported by Apple in OS X, and AACS, an encryption standard. Some blu-ray discs use BD+ but that has proven completely ineffective. However, AACS and BD+ are transparent to the users the same way CSS and other DVD protection methods are. You'll never see it and you'll never be affected by it.I'm going to say that every single negative thing you read in this thread about blu-ray disc is flat out false. Things made up by the anti-blu-ray crowd or those who have never watched a movie on blu-ray, or just take Jobs word as gospel.And, again, as the anti-blu-ray crowd keeps seeming to forget and ignore, licensing for blu-ray is now a one stop shop. You pay one fee to one entity. That changed shortly after Jobs &quot;bag of hurt&quot; comment and the change to that setup was already in motion prior to his comment.</text>

I doubt RED One is used on more productions than everyone else combined.I'm not definitely saying that 8K is a common (far from it). However, since cinema space has been pushing towards 4K strongly in 2009- there is lot more incentive to capture in higher res. Currently there are two cameras in mainstream digital cinematography over 2K. You have the current Red One (4.5K) and then you have Dalsa Origin (I and II / first one was really a custom and not a real production model but still it was the first 4K cam)(4K). The production model, Origin II was released in 2007 or 2008. Regarding use of Origin II its really aimed for VFX use. In 2K you have the ones you mentioned plus Phantom HD (goes to 1000 fps in HD and max res 2048x2048 in 30 fps and under if I remember correctly), GS Vitec noX 2K and Kinor. In high end (and I truly mean high end...) you have the pre-production and custom solutions. In 2011 there is strong possibility that Epic will be released and the &quot;low cost&quot; Scarlet. Then you have the 4K Canon cam and 4K from Sony waiting in the pipe line and probably lot more that I know nothing about.

Its also the broadcasters that looking to gain edge on competition with &quot;advanced tech solutions&quot;. I do somewhat understand their point of view. You can't really create quality content with brute force but you can sugar coat your average content with resolution and 3d and sell it as a premium product. Regarding my personal view on res or 3D; content is the king and that says it all. For &quot;high compression fanboys&quot;; I have problem when grain and artifacts are distracting the audience from the content -&gt; many online distribution solutions.</text>

With regular SD and mpeg2 stream from broadcaster (no double or re-compressions) you need at least stable 8Mbps pipe. To deal with quality HD you are looking at 50Mbits. Some call this &quot;Ultimate HD&quot; I call it HD. In reality you need pipes of 100Mbits if you want to be free from preset content providers. Naturally you can stream it with less bandwidth but then again who wants to see pixels, grain and artifacts making the whole experience more like a tech exercise then anything else. Its true you can push &quot;HD like res&quot; stream in 5Mbits pipe but it really has nothing to do with quality that is commonly associated with HD.One thing people tend to forget with online distribution is the local storage needs. Do you want to store all those GB's on your HD or would you prefer a optical media to store the files? Cloud storage is a viable solution but then again you need the fat pipes and high reliability and even then you would really want to have the option to store the files locally and preferably onto some robust and inexpensive media (such as optical). Hence, Apple really isn't looking at the picture from consumers or from content providers perspective. Its all about locking in the consumer and content provider into iTunes model which in matter of fact only servers small portion of total market and even then is very limited in what you can and how you can offer it.</text>

I would also like to record them to physical media (BD) because I am sure if something would happen to the drives they are stored in. and to the backup Stevo/Apple would not even say sorry.</text>

It would also be a PR nightmare to have a data-only BluRay drive and have to explain it to people. Much better PR to just keep it off the system completely.What we should do is Lobby for the BR consortium to allow for BR to be played back with a 3rd party only solution, thereby allowing apple to make a BluRay app (Similar to DVD). But as anyone familiar with the matter will tell you, it will not / can not happen.Karl Pwould you care to explain how is adobe doing it? I have authored a few blu-rays with Encore and they look pretty dam good.</text>

We are still waiting to see what happens but if we are not seeing solid development on FC product range, servers, OS X server and in Xsan we are forced to choose alternative solutions meaning go to Windows, Avid etc. That will mean company wide change in platforms. In reality consumers can live with the thought of Apple being difficult and pulling out products when they feel like it but for business users even a thought of taking a risk where a perfectly usable platform is pulled from underneath you is one you just can't take. I think everyone who work in moving image remember what happened to Shake. Xserve might have been a loss leader but it truly was a gateway for many Mac workstations too. If you had those two then it was easy to bring in iPhones etc. to the company. With Xserve out of the picture you really end up closing a very clear gateway. Regrading Mac Pro/Mini Server -&gt;a server? NO! Hell, Apple should see Xserve and Mac OS X Server as marketing tools for business users.</text>

While you and I know that a Mini is probably adequate for many installations, I've been told point blank by corporate IT that they would never allow such a device to host their data.</text>

I don't think that is a particurlarly astute observation.The thing is you don't need to be one or the other.  In fact, Apple could have done everything the same way in the Xserve debacle, except for one minor difference : Offer an upgrade path.  They only cut the hardware out, all that the people that are now left to dry need is hardware to run OS X Server on (since it still exists).  Apple thought the Mac Pro was it, which shows how disconnected they are when it comes to datacenter design (I hope the guy who took this decision isn't also in charge of their own data center).Apple already have a link to VMWare, where they allow virtualization of OS X server on Apple hardware.  It would have been easy to simply extend that to all hardware vendors.  The upgrade path would then have simply been to install OS X Server into existing ESXi environnements most of us have already.</text>

It's the best implementation of Netflix ever. The software interface is perfect and it's zippy. As long as you have a decent internet connection (7-10 Mbps or better) I defy anyone to notice any significant audio or image degradation.As for Blu Ray players, I have a Samsung BD-C7900 which loads as fast as my previous DVD player, in fact it is one of the fastest on the market, and it includes wireless connectivity. Online content has been fine.Compared to the cost of high(er) speed internet plus a Netflix or other type of subscription, I save money by paying for a slower internet speed, renting movies I am interested in, and purchasing only those I will re-watch (I rewatch my favorite movies many times). Plus the instant access to a Blu Ray disc (or my many DVDs) is faster and more convenient than the unreliable internet in my area.</text>

I'd imagine that if Apple doesn't decide to completely kill off the ability to image and manage their systems via network, you'll wind up plugins for those as well (that simply point to SMB or NFS shares).I really think we've seen the last OS X Server with SL...Here's another question, what's going on with ARD?</text>

	<text>'Good to know that Apple is revamping Quicktime for Lion, and will have an interim FCS release for Snow Leopard. Apple has a history of being a late bloomer, but seizes the market with their products. Hopefully, that'll be the case with FCS.Nevertheless, I think those who need native editing today should switch, although for teams of editors, that will be an initial disaster with a slowdown in production, not to mention significant expenditures.

The problem is that the back end needs are exactly the same.  Often, the people picking a platform by intended use and acquiring the funding (via grant or budget allocation) are not savvy in the server room.I walked into a school district that had close to a thousand Macs spread across 30+ locations (a drop in the bucket compared to their fourteen thousand plus Dells) and was asked to build a network deployment mechanism and write a support policy for those Macs.  Why?  Because they existed entirely outside of the support department.  In the past two years, that number is closer to fifteen hundred plus our iOS devices.  I was asked to stay on permanently and now I've inherited all those systems full time (maintaining them from a sysadmin standpoint and training the Windows techs to support them in the field).I'm not trying to sidetrack you with a personal story; I'm only looking to answer your question with a clear cut example.  Write what you know, right?The point is; I completely agree with you.  But that doesn't matter.  Regardless of whether or not I trust Apple, I have a lot of Macs in the field that must be maintained.  They are integrated into lesson plans, teachers rely upon them and students use them on a daily basis.  They are part of a system that existed before me and my job is to devise a method of continued support.I'm a Linux guy, myself.  I've made a living off of finding solutions to problems;  which is probably why I've stayed on as long as I have.  It's been a string of interesting challenges.  Now I've begun to hit a wall:  Reality.  Can solutions be created?  Yes; but they'll likely be very unique solutions due to Apple's evolving business model.Interesting times, to say the least.</text>

Which format has the more restrictive DRM? Let's see here.&quot;FairPlay&quot; (iTunes) content requires HDCP for the monitor, display output, and connection. The video file can only be played on a certain number of computers, and it can only be played on Apple portable devices. You cannot lend the file to a friend nor can you sell it. You also can't take it over to a friends house unless you lug Apple hardware with you and all the appropriate adapters to connect the hardware.Blu-ray disc requires HDCP the same as iTunes for HD content. The disc can be played on any device that has a blu-ray reader. It can be played on everything from game consoles to PC blu-ray readers, to any set top blu-ray player. It can literally be played anywhere. Plus you can lend it to a friend, take just the disc and not all the hardware to a friends house, and you can sell the disc if you ever choose to.As for all the other nonsense you hear about blu-ray playback, it's just that, nonsense. I have absolutely NEVER had to update the firmware in my standalone player to play a new movie. Never. Not once. And I only ever had to update the software player in Windows ONE time to play a new movie.Blu-ray disc is truly plug and play. While you have to jump through all kinds of hoops and use proprietary hardware as well as proprietary adapters to get your iTunes content on to your TV.Then it comes down to quality. Blu-ray disc video is encoded at up to 1920x1080, up to 45Mbps H.264 or VC-1 video (only a handful of very old first generation discs used MPEG-2), with lossless or sometimes uncompressed audio. iTunes &quot;HD&quot; content? Encoded at 1280x720, slightly less than half the resolution, 4-5Mbps H.264 video (yes, about 1/10th the max bit-rate), and sub DVD quality 384Kbps Dolby Digital audio.Now let's talk about price.RedBox does individual blu-ray rentals for $1.50 per night. iTunes is $4.99. And given the file size, even on my FiOS connection, it's still faster for me to go to the local RedBox and get the blu-ray disc I want. Plus I can get that $1.50 blu-ray disc and take it over a friends house and watch it there and not have to lug my Mac, adapters, and cables along with me to watch it.For purchases, iTunes charges around $20. Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Fry's, Amazon, etc. have a ton of blu-ray discs under $20. In fact, Target and Walmart both have a section dedicated to $10 blu-ray discs. These aren't the same movies you'll find in the $5 DVD bin, but recent releases.As for sales numbers, I don't see why people keep saying &quot;DVD is outselling blu-ray disc!&quot;. For one, thats not always true. Two, people seem to forget that DVD was on the market for 7 full years before it FINALLY overtook VHS, in 2003. DVD's success was NOT overnight. Blu-ray is being adopted faster than DVD was, about twice the rate. Blu-ray disc sales set records nearly every quarter. Blu-ray disc will kill DVD at some point in the future.But online streaming? People seem to think that &quot;On Demand&quot; and online streaming services will kill blu-ray disc. Not a chance. For a few reasons. One, On Demand is expensive. Again, $5 or sometimes even $6 for a high definition movie. Same movie at RedBox with better quality is $1.50. Or if you watch a lot of movies, a Blockbuster or Netflix subscription costs the same as 3 On Demand movies. If people try to use On Demand services the way they currently watch blu-ray discs or DVDs, they'll be in for a major case of sticker shock at the end of the month when their TV bill comes and it has an extra $40-$50 tacked on.Online streaming won't kill blu-ray disc or DVD any time soon either. Why? A couple of reasons. One is quality. As myself and others have pointed out already, blu-ray disc runs at twice the resolution with up to 10x the video bit-rate of iTunes &quot;HD&quot; content. Not to mention the better audio. Even the standard definition stuff doesn't match up because theres no good way of scaling H.264 SD video to higher quality displays, while a good upscaling DVD player can easily make a DVD look better (due to lack of compression artifacting) than iTunes &quot;HD&quot; video.The second biggest reason online streaming won't kill optical media is both bandwidth and metered billing. Believe it or not, in most places around the world, metered billing (Bandwidth caps) is a way of life. ISPs here in the US drool over the thought of metered billing and several have already imposed caps. Smaller cable operators in small towns already have extremely low caps. We have yet to see how things will play out, but we'll probably see metered billing with high overages before we see online video overtake optical media. Then you'd have to factor in the cost to download plus the cost of the video. Online video would die pretty quick if you had to pay $5 for the file then another $2 for bandwidth. Plus theres actual speed. Some of us are lucky enough to live in areas that have FiOS or other high speed connections, but the recent FCC survey showed that most people are on sub-3Mbps connections. That means it would take longer to download that iTunes movie than it would to watch it. With the average blu-ray file being around 25-30Mbps, that means it could take as long as ten times as long as the movie is to download it. I don't know about you, but if I didn't have my FiOS connection, I sure wouldn't wait several hours just to download a movie. Not when I could go to RedBox and get it for a fraction of the price, or have a Blockbuster by Mail subscription that includes in-store exchanges. And the situation regarding internet service in this country isn't going to get any better since the Democrats have no spine and won't stand up for consumers stuck with a duopoly and the &quot;Party of No&quot; have enough people in Congress to stop progress.So let's summarize here:All of this nonsense about blu-ray DRM is a myth. OS X already supports HDCP. AACS and BD+ are the &quot;encryption&quot; schemes used by blu-ray disc, the same way CSS and other various forms of disc protection are used on DVD. This would be supported by the player. The same way CSS and other DVD protections have to be supported and updated in the player. blu-ray is absolutely 100% a plug and play technology for every single standalone blu-ray player and the vast majority of computers shipped over the last couple of years. Every shipping Mac supports HDCP, and every Mac with a mini DisplayPort since 2008 supports it.And most importantly, all of this nonsense regarding blu-ray licensing is also 100% fiction. Shortly after Jobs made that short sighted &quot;bag of hurt&quot; comment, the BDA made changes to licensing fees. Now its a one stop shop and one fee. Just like DVD.So, the fact that Macs support HDCP, the encryption DRM needs to be supported in the player the exact same way as DVD, and licensing is now no different than DVD means there is absolutely no reason whatsoever for Macs to not support blu-ray disc in OS X. Especially considering I can reboot into Windows on my 2008 unibody MacBook and play a blu-ray disc without issues.Just to add another point to what you said.What about people around the world that the stores don't have movies and tv series? How are they suppose to see movies and tv series if they take Steve Jobs word?</text>

Maybe for video games, but not for film.Not to derail this thread but 35mm, from what I've read, is generally considered to be around 6k and anything beyond that is just capturing the grain structure of the film but not any additional image detail.  2k is the most common res for scanning film in for post production although for FX shots they'll bump it up to 4k.  The release prints, what are shown in the theaters, are around 2k but the quality quickly degrades over time as the film is handled and/or shown.  IMAX I can't really comment on but they did just announce a 4k digital camera for IMAX (which seems too low res but I haven't tried to follow up on it to learn more).Most pros, if they are digital, are shooting HD.  Star Wars Ep. II and II, Zodica, Avatar, Miami Vice, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Apocalypto, Public Enemies, etc., were all shot 1080p.  Red is only general purpose d-cinema camera that shoots above 2k and there are only 2-3 that shoot 2k (ex. Arri Alexa, SI-2k).Lethal</text>

This is because part of film's detail is due to the fact that film is a random assortment of grain. Our brains combine detail from adjacent frames (detail that might be present in one frame, but not in another) to form a higher resolution image. When you start increasing the rate at which frames are captured and exhibited, you're basically increasing this psychological effect, further increasing the resolution beyond what 35mm film can produce today.What I'm saying is that digital projection doesn't have this luxury (which is what Cameron is suggesting). If you increase the frame rate, you are only increasing &quot;motion resolution,&quot; but because digital media uses a set matrix of detail, you cannot increase spatial resolution by increasing frame rate.However, in my opinion, 24fps is absolutely perfect for what film is trying to accomplish. It is slow enough for our brains to accept the image as a memory (vs reality), which is beneficial because of emotional connection to the film. But it is fast enough that we can still perceive motion. For fiction films, 24fps is great, however, I can totally see how visually strong documentaries, IMAX or otherwise, could really benefit from this.</text>

Not a chance.In a theoretical BEST CHANCE, BEST CASE, FIRST GENERATION, 35mm film role you'd have a chance of getting 6k. Maybe. That's generous. With analog you can debate away a few thousand lines here and there pretty easy.I don't know many 35mm/Super 35/etc films that have a 6k pipeline from beginning to end. If it's perfectly transferred and played back digitally, most films probably hit 2k. If it's 35mm projected, it's far worse. Most film will see about 1,000 lines of vertical resolution or less when it's actually in a theater.&quot;At this point, the typical audience cannot see the difference between HD and 35mm. Even professionals have a hard time telling them apart. We go through this all the time at NYU (&quot;Was this shot on film or video?&quot;).&quot;http://www.filmschooldirect.com/samp...HD_vs_35mm.htmAs for IMAX, again, you're talking pie in the sky numbers.From John Galt...&quot;The 4K system that most people know is IMAX -- and it doesn't quite make 4K, which is a surprise to people. &#8220;How can that possibly be?,&#8221; you say. &#8220;It's an enormous big frame.&#8221; Well, because of what I was talking about earlier: the physics of optics. When you take the entire system into account &#8211; from the lens of the camera, to the the movement of the light through the projector, all slightly reducing resolution -- you wind up with less than the full resolution you started with.&quot;http://magazine.creativecow.net/arti...ture-of-pixelsMaybe I'm way off base, but that's what I've seen, read, and been told. Anything you have to share to the contrary would obviously be an education for me, as I put my knowledge squarely at lower-middle. ^_^BTW, IMAX trumps Blu-ray, no question. Huge difference. Ditto to a lesser extend for 65 and 70mm.</text>

He probably says &quot;can't do that&quot; mentally a lot due to our &quot;learned&quot; preference for a lower frame rate.A higher frame rate SHOULD be an option for film makers, just like a lack of color is still an option for film makers. It doesn't have to be an all or none proposition, just another tool in the tool box. You use the term aesthetics when referring to higher frame rates, but don't forget, widescreen, sound and color were added after the fact not because they were inferior to silent B&amp;W films. I don't see how a higher frame rate doesn't also land in this category.I don't look at higher frame rates the same as smooth screen technology on TVs. The tearing, smoothing, and general artifacts that come along for the ride are why I don't care for that option...</text>

Most film will see about 1,000 lines of vertical resolution or less when it's actually in a theater.&quot;At this point, the typical audience cannot see the difference between HD and 35mm. Even professionals have a hard time telling them apart. We go through this all the time at NYU (&quot;Was this shot on film or video?&quot;).&quot;http://www.filmschooldirect.com/samp...HD_vs_35mm.htmAs for IMAX, again, you're talking pie in the sky numbers.From John Galt...&quot;The 4K system that most people know is IMAX -- and it doesn't quite make 4K, which is a surprise to people. &ldquo;How can that possibly be?,&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;It's an enormous big frame.&rdquo; Well, because of what I was talking about earlier: the physics of optics. When you take the entire system into account &ndash; from the lens of the camera, to the the movement of the light through the projector, all slightly reducing resolution -- you wind up with less than the full resolution you started with.&quot;http://magazine.creativecow.net/arti...ture-of-pixelsMaybe I'm way off base, but that's what I've seen, read, and been told. Anything you have to share to the contrary would obviously be an education for me, as I put my knowledge squarely at lower-middle. ^_^BTW, IMAX trumps Blu-ray, no question. Huge difference. Ditto to a lesser extend for 65 and 70mm.Sorry, I misspoke. What I meant to say is that 35mm OCN is easily 8K. A lot of people don't believe that 35mm can exceed 6K resolution, but it really does. We're talking about also including the blending of adjacent frames here... Not just pure amount of detail. Our brains see a higher amount of detail than there is in the frame because it combines detail from adjacent frames. It's not a lot of extra detail, but it gives a slight bump in resolution. 35mm OCN truly does hold about 8K worth of information. We don't have scanners that can extract that information, and the photochemical process chops out some information too, so we really have no way of reproducing it to that degree yet. I have worked with 16mm for quite a while yet, and I have projected all different kinds of film, be it color positive prints or color reversals, and I can honestly say that it exceeds 1080P by a long shot. Even the color positives, which would be prints of OCN material. It looks utterly fantastic. I have talked long and hard with laboratory professionals, including people who have actually measured the amount of sharpness and detail in film, and everyone agrees on this basic formula (these are all OCN, not counting prints or anything): 16mm - 4K, 35mm - 8K, 65mm - 16K, IMAX - 28K. Obviously these are estimated, but they are a lot more accurate than you'd think.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byMac'nCheeseJust rewatched most of the entire trilogy. Had fond memories of all of em but, I don't know, they just don't hold up. A lot of it is just downright creepy (Hey let's hire Biff because without him, we wouldn't have met. Yeah, without him trying to RAPE YOU!) And marty is just a whiny little d-bag who would have grown up to be a loser with loser kids without the help of that guy from taxi.And such is telling of the general tolerance of the population.  Me, I haven't seen a movie I really - REALLY - enjoyed and would consider paying for in years.  The last one wasn't even made in America; the quality of that movie was top notch.  The American filmmakers back in the days of BTTF were more concerned with writing a fun story and creating memorable characters with simple camera angles than they were with special effects and the &quot;Bourne&quot; motion blurring (which irritates me to no end) and numerous fight scenes and stuff being blown up.  It gets old, fast.In any event BTTF Blu-ray on the Sharp Quattron is an amazing experience.  The quality of everything is top tier and you feel like you're standing on the filming lot at times, which is the exact experience I want.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bycubistWhat does Steve want us to do backups to? Thumbdrives?I'd like to see BD drives in Macs, but backing up isn't (in my opinion) much of an argument for it. There's just too much data to back up these days that it isn't practical to use DVDs or BDs for this purpose (not to mention that optical media isn't very reliable for archival purposes).For modern computers, you really need a scheme utilizing some combination of hard drives and online. For instance, in my case, I use a 2 TB drive in my MacPro to provide Time Machine backups for the other 3 HDs in my computer and my wife's Mac Mini. I also have a 2 TB external drive with 4 partitions that I use to make CarbonCopyCloner backups once a month of all the drives (except the Time Machine drive). This drive is then stored off premises.The fact of the matter is that optical discs are not much of a choice for backup purposes these days, even if Blu-ray were available for the Mac.</text>

	<text>&quot; Jobs noted during a recent internal meeting that he is &quot;ashamed&quot; that Apple's name is associated with the Blu-ray format&quot;And I am ashamed I ever was so stupid as to choose Apple over Windows when Amiga went down; I should have gone straight to Windows and never been suckered in by that wannabe toymaker clown.If Lion doesn't implement Blu-ray, I'm gone for good, and my 12 core and 8 core towers will both be up on eBay along with all my Apple software including every Pro App made.Already I've held off on updating to CS5 Master Suite because I know deep down I'll probably be buying the windows version from scratch.I and my business need COMPUTERS from a CUTTING-EDGE COMPUTER MANUFACTURER; not five-year old technology neglected models from a FAD TOYMAKER.</text>

	<text>I'm on CS5 for Mac right now, and it's pretty nice. I have an nVidia GTX285 card coming Monday, and that should cut down some of the crazy render times. This will hold my head above water for a while, hopefully long enough to see the next Final Cut version, as I've been curious to see what Apple is really capable of. If I'm not sufficiently impressed, I'll return to building PC edit suites.</text>

They replaced them w/Apple-centric product tours and they also make appearances at some of the bigger FCP user groups.  Last year at NAB, for example, they were at the Supermeet in Vegas (a giant, joint meeting of many FCP user groups from across the country).Lethal</text>
