	<text>Last month,we pointedto research from media firm Nielsen indicating that Apple's iPhone had finally surpassed Research in Motion's BlackBerry operating system in smartphone market share in the United States in October.  In afollow-up postyesterday, Nielsen released numbers for November indicating that Apple has widened its lead over Research in Motion, which is now in danger of falling behind Google's Android operating system.It has been a remarkable turnaround over the past six months, with Apple's share of new smartphone purchases in the U.S. holding relatively steady in the ~26% range for purchases over each preceding six-month period while Android has surged to over 40% and Research in Motion has fallen to under 20%.  As recently as July, all three operating systems had been tightly clustered in the 25-28% range.In another look at market share among the various smartphone platforms, Net Applications has released itsbrowser usage numbersfor December 2010, which examine worldwide browser usage and incorporate all iOS devices instead of just the iPhone as limited by smartphone studies.In its study, Net Applications finds that iOS usage surged across the board between November and December as new customers came on board in the holiday season, with iOS usage share growing 24.3% month-to-month to claim 1.69% of total Internet browser usage.  The iPad led Apple's charge with 33.3% share growth, with the iPod claiming 25% growth and the iPhone 20% growth.  While Android experienced a slightly higher rate of share growth of 29%, its overall share of 0.40% remained far behind that of iOS, illustrating the impact of Apple's broader iOS ecosystem that extends well beyond smartphones.</text>

	<text>It is funny how the popular perception for months has been that Android has already overtaken iOS in the US.Now obviously that day will come very soon, but it is funny how the perception differs from reality.In Europe I believe iOS still leads over Android. And it a few other territories as well. And of course the other platforms (notably Symbian and Blackberry) are strong in their areas as well.Apple is playing the platform game with iOS in set top boxes, media players and tablets. In terms tackling the whole eco system Android has yet to really get started.</text>

	<text>That's pretty good considering that it's one OS on one piece of hardware (iPhone) compared to many flavors of Android and many different hardware devices.I wonder how the numbers would look if there was only one flavor of Android and one hardware device like the iPhone.</text>

	<text>Android will gain on iOS until Apple iphones move to more carriers.  Then I would expect iOS usage to jump quite a bit.  Probably not quite a majority but a plurality of quite a margin.  Probably 45%.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted by&#x17D;algirisEither it's OS vs OS or manufacturer vs manufacturer. Now it's apples and oranges.Let's put it this way: iOS based phones vs. Android based phonesbut honestly: those numbers don't matter too much. They show that iOS Phones does not suffer due to Android Phones and Android Phones does not suffer due to iOS Phones - the only looser is RIM. Yes, Android Phones will take over the iOS Phones - with a bigger variety of hardware chances are more Android based phones are soled - so what? - the market for smart phones is growing and has room for both. Everybody can select what fits their needs. Android Phones and iOS Phones are very similar, and for the user it is a matter of preferences based on rather small details.  Good thing everybody can select what they want and that those two don't kill each other - that way both will keep up adding more features - good for everyone. I personally love my iPhone 4 and won't trade it for any Android based one, but that is my opinion and others might prefer the Android.</text>

Headline should really read: iOS soon to be surpassed by android.... assuming, of course, that the status quo remain the status quo. Any change--say, by the iPhone adding Verizon to its market path--could accelerate iOS and slow Android for more than a year and perhaps even permanently if when Android contracts begin to expire, users choose not to buy another one. Brand or platform loyalty is as important as the 'innovation.' Android is the new kid on the block right now, but unless it's done a good enough job to generate loyal users, that new kid could become a pariah once the newness wears off.</text>

Motorola were in the gutter, Samsung have recently hit the 10 million milestone with their Galaxy S line of phones and HTC have come on in strides in brand awareness and profits. I don't see any of that as a bad thing for those companies.Google are at a distinct advantage too because it doesn't really matter what platform you use thir services on be it iOS, Windows Phone, Symbian or any other platform. They still get their share of data and advertising.Both Google and Apple will continue to do well I think.</text>

Sure when you have hundreds of phone models everywhere, people will buy them, but that's not because they are loyal to your brand.  Long term, this is not the best approach to take if you care about Android.Just one observation: There are plenty of people who are not interested in a smartphone at all, just a mobile phone to make and receive phone calls. And many of those people don't want to look cheap and be seen with a £15 phone, because most of them are just ugly. There are plenty of Android phones that are cheap enough for this group of people. If you don't want any smart features at all, and have enough money to easily afford a £99 phone without contract, then you might end up with an Android phone, but not with an iPhone. Not that Apple loses out much, just as they didn't lose any sales to netbooks. That's also the reason why the iPhone share in browser use is much higher than Android's.The point is that you can sell four very cheap Android phones and make the same revenue as Apple makes with one iPhone, and a tiny fraction of the profit.</text>

	<text>As both an iPhone and Android (EVO) user I can tell you the Android phone is a second class platform. Android has lots of apps, some are even free vs paid on IOS. The usability is where Android really loses its luster. One newly discovered difference is when you have to replace one Android phone with another. It is frustrating and based on the responses from HTC impossible to completely restore the config from one phone to another. Sure, contacts and calenders are easy to recover. Paid for applications are right in the market to be re-downloaded. Everything else has to be restored manually and that is a MAJOR oversight. Compare that with when I replaced my 1 gen iPhone with a 3G. I plugged in the 1 gen iPhone, and iTunes backed it up, swapped SIM cards and plugged in the new iPhone. Activated it, and it asked if I wanted to do a restore and what back up I wanted to restore. I chose the recent one and walked away. I came back at some point later the phone was ready to go, every setting, every app, every photo, all the contacts and my calender were up to date. There are several other shortcomings, none so glaring as this one. AT&amp;T still sucks which is why I got an EVO in the first place.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byChazUKIs there any brand value in a free, open source operating system?I agree with you that both Google and Apple will do well, but I highlight this one sentence because I think that's how most people think of Android.

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byFull of WinThe trend is your friend, and those lines projected forward spell trouble for Apple.In what way? Apple's trend is still trending up. Yes so is Android, but it's 20 devices vs one device. Plus, since these are US numbers its 5 carriers vs 1 carrier. I think we'd see a different chart if the iPhone was available on more carriers... which should be happening soon. The only &quot;trouble&quot; I see in the trends is RIM... they are trending down.As always... thanks for the positive input!</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byfoodogAs both an iPhone and Android (EVO) user I can tell you the Android phone is a second class platform. Android has lots of apps, some are even free vs paid on IOS. The usability is where Android really loses its luster. One newly discovered difference is when you have to replace one Android phone with another. It is frustrating and based on the responses from HTC impossible to completely restore the config from one phone to another. Sure, contacts and calenders are easy to recover. Paid for applications are right in the market to be re-downloaded. Everything else has to be restored manually and that is a MAJOR oversight. Compare that with when I replaced my 1 gen iPhone with a 3G. I plugged in the 1 gen iPhone, and iTunes backed it up, swapped SIM cards and plugged in the new iPhone. Activated it, and it asked if I wanted to do a restore and what back up I wanted to restore. I chose the recent one and walked away. I came back at some point later the phone was ready to go, every setting, every app, every photo, all the contacts and my calender were up to date. There are several other shortcomings, none so glaring as this one. AT&amp;T still sucks which is why I got an EVO in the first place.i really dont know what the hell your talking about, you pop your MicroSD with your stuff on it and throw it in the new phone..... ive gone through 8+ android phones like this. didnt loose anything (contacts, calender, email are on exchange, rest of my stuff is on MicroSD)</text>

And of course the other platforms (notably Symbian and Blackberry) are strong in their areas as well.Apple is playing the platform game with iOS in set top boxes, media players and tablets. In terms tackling the whole eco system Android has yet to really get started.You know you are right? There is already an IOS phone, PMP, Tablet, Set Top Box....and they all integrate with each other perfectly and there are more ways for them to integrate in the months and years to come. Plus apple stuff is worth some money after a year of use, unlike android and all other electronics in this space.</text>

	<text>The scenario in the US:Various Android phones (by different manufacturers) are available on every carrier (including pay-as-you-go) and are heavily subsidized across many (buy one get one free, etc.).What do you expect?What's impressive is that the iPhone (one manufacturer) is available on only one carrier (AT&amp;T) with a subsidy not even comparable and it still puts up numbers like that. That's impressive.Didn't a recent poll show that most users want an iPhone and either can't afford it or it's not available on their carrier. Pretty simple to me.</text>

	<text>The Android numbers can climb to a clear majority without affecting the iOS ecosystem.  Why?Android customers don't spend anywhere near as much money per person on apps.  Many don't buy paid apps at all.  Developers usually follow the money, so iOS is where most of the cool new stuff and creative apps will happen first.  Customers who want the cool apps will continue to buy enough devices from Apple and apps from the App store to keep iOS with a healthy and profitable market share, even if Android use climbs to 50%+.</text>

	<text>If you think about it this is really a non story really. Looking at these numbers this had better be true for Android OS. Android is on how many phones? On how many carriers? Now if Android OS and iOS were to swap numbers that would be something to post about.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byfirewoodThe Android numbers can climb to a clear majority without affecting the iOS ecosystem.  Why?Android customers don't spend anywhere near as much money per person on apps.  Many don't buy paid apps at all.  Developers usually follow the money, so iOS is where most of the cool new stuff and creative apps will happen first.  Customers who want the cool apps will continue to buy enough devices from Apple and apps from the App store to keep iOS with a healthy and profitable market share, even if Android use climbs to 50%+.not really, developers want a large customer base as well (more ads seen = more money in alot of cases)if android has more users, your chance of more users that download your program is on android.but your partially correct, people that use iOS dont usually have a problem with paying (just look at how much apple stuff costs)so paid program = iOSfree ad program = Android</text>

How long it takes to JB an iPhone? Let's say 10 sec?Don't start with the argument that Apple is not allowing people on doing it because as all we know is really a non-issue JB an iPhone as well as for Android people to get 3rd party Apps.</text>

	<text>From the perspective of a company, what is more important - Market Share or Profit?Higher market share does not lead automatically to higher profits. You can dump your stuff for almost free on the market but make almost no money or you sell it for the price it's worth (or more, but so that enough people still buy it) and make lots of money (but loose out on market share). But profits is all that those companies are about (they are not charities). Would be interesting to see a breakdown by (phone based) profits across the phone manufactures.</text>

But that's ok, the girl that sat next to me in class, her father bought her an iPhone. I didn't say it, but she said that the iPhone is a girl's phone, and I thought that was interesting since the Droid X is promoted more towards guys, because it has a big screen.</text>

Their precious Canadian email server that they fought up to the US Supreme Court to keep is being by passed by the mass market.  From that, they have to do something other than their softly received tablet.As far as big losers, HP / Palm and Nokia was not even mentioned.

	<text>It's a no brainer that Android will surpass iOS in the mobile phone share, considering the fact that there are tons of Android phones chasing the iPhone 4 &amp; iPhone 3GS. However things may change once the iPhone reaches more carriers in the U.S. I personally know a lot of people with other carriers that are using an Android phone because it's the closest thing to the iPhone for them. I have to say in my opinion it was a major mistake for Apple to limit themselves to AT&amp;T in the U.S. for all this time. Let's hope all this Verizon iPhone hype is true!</text>

(or just edit the hosts file)(you are still contract free as well as carrier free at this point)i think the only thing you need to download angrybirds is........... an internet connection you dont even need a gmail account just get the APK file and throw it on your phonethat $150 phone probably would be an Acer Liquid, im sure you can get it even cheaper if you look, it would be running 2.1 out of the box if it was unrooted, if rooted you can run 2.3 or whatever you feel like running</text>

Which rarely happened and will probably be similar for Android/WinMo 7.After eight years of downloading cooked ROMs or asking friends and former co-workers for ROM updates, I was done.

You're assuming I secretly want an iPhone, but I don't. All of the right pieces are in place for me to get an iPhone, and yet, I still don't want one. I have an Android phone and love it, and will only be upgrading to a new Android phone in the future.I think he was simply pointing out that there are many Android users (on OTHER networks) that really want the iPhone but is not available to them. He wasn't singling you out.</text>

Part of the reason why is the example you used: game companies like iOS because people actually pay for those games.  And where the developers go, the software goes, and that's with iOS.  That's not going to change until Android users start showing a willingness to support software with their wallet.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bysrxtrI thought both iOS and Android had paid / free / ad apps.They do both have paid, free, and ad supported apps.It's not the OS's and devices that are different.  But the typical or average behavior of their respective customers is very different.Android owners rarely buy apps.  Maybe Android owners like looking at ads?  Thus Android developers have to target making money from ads (not much money per customer, so developers have to break even by getting a massive number of people to download and run their apps).A much higher percentage of iPhone owners buy apps, and those who buy apps buy more apps.  Thus there is more App store money for the iOS developer community per each device owner, on average, and a paid app developer can make money with only a modest amount of downloads per day.  Thus a larger iOS dev community.  Only ten $9.99 apps per day is $25K per annum (decent for a university student), how many ad impressions does it take to match that income stream?</text>

Welcome aboard!OK, seriously, the press prints anti-Apple articles all the time.  By anti-Apple, I mean by printing the side of issues that make Apple look worse.  By repeating debunked lies.  By slanting coverage away from Apple.I see it all the time.  If you don't, I ask you to please look at the news over the next few months and see if you don't see the media leap to report negative Apple issues.  It's true they also push good Apple stories.  They sort of have to now that Apple is one of the most successful companies in U.S. history.  But some of us remember what it was like a decade or two ago when it was all about 'Apple is doomed' and the like.  Those old prejudices are still there, but they have to be hidden a bit because of the ridiculous amount of money Apple makes now.But if you don't see it, that's fine.  My statement was still not the most ridiculous thing you've ever read.  It's not even the most ridiculous statement you'll read today, or even in this thread.</text>

	<text>It looks like Android is taking away from RIM market share and not Apple.Since this is US only, it seems to mean that cdma users (sprint, verizon and gsm tmobile) are dropping Blackberries to Android smart phones, while ATT users are stable.It will be interesting to see the trend when and if Apple releases the iPhone for Verizon. So its not clear that Android will surpass iOS...but anything goes.The data seems to indicate that cdma (and tmobile) users want a better smart phone than BB has...and the only option is Android if they stay with Verizon, sprint, and Tmobile. Of course there are att users that switch, but on average, the plot show apple flat, BB going down at the same rate than Android moves up.One thing that is under appreciated is service.  Walk in to any apple store and get your hardware/software fixed or examined. No so true with all other smart phone makers.  That is a big deal to customers.</text>

Both have their upsides and downsides.Personally, I wouldabsolutely loveto own an iPhone; but as a student, I just can't afford to pay $70+ a month. (And that's limited features)I own an Android device.  For the most part I love it, but it's still a love/hate relationship sometimes.  Functionality wise- Apple beats the pants off Android....but hey, I'm paying $25 a month for unlimited data, unlimited texting, and 300 minutes of talk time.</text>

Though I somehow doubt that people will be so happy when 5 year old Android games get ported to iOS in the future...Not sure how you came up with those exact numbers - but the exact number anyway does not matter: I agree he is happy with a smaller percentage of the market share as long as he makes more money with it than all the others with there big market shares. Market share (as long as above a certain threshold so that the product has some visibility) doesn't mean too much for a company - what counts (for the company, shareholders, etc) is how much money they squeeze out of this market share, and this is where apple (as a corporation) wins. What good is 90% market share if the one with 10% market share makes more money? Guess the one with 90% is doing something wrong in that case.</text>

So are you suggesting, that the iPhone will sell 3 times better when it comes to other carriers in the US? I highly doubt that.</text>

	<text>That analysis isVERYmisleading for a couple of reasons:1) It includes the iPad, which is not what I really call a &quot;smartphone,&quot; since the 3G connectivity is used in addition to the normal 802.11 Wi-Fi connection.2) If you measure it onnewphone sales within the past four months, Android-based phones combined are now out-selling the iPhone 4. This is especially true with the MotorolaDroidseries, the various HTC phones and the SamsungGalaxy Sseries phones using Android 2.1 and 2.2 reaching retailers during the course of 2010.In short, in terms of current monthly new-phone sales, Android-based phones are now out-pacing the iPhone 4.</text>

If I cared about market share I wouldn't have a Mac.One things for sure though. I don't think there will be one dominant OS in the mobile space. It's going to be more competitive than the PC market.I'm glad someone had the sense to point those things out. Kudos to you.I'm not sure why people get quite so defensive over their phone-buying choice; I might well buy an iPhone in the not-too-distant future but it is difficult for me to justify spending potentially hundreds of extra pounds for a phone with few extra features over an Android-based phone (and, as an aside, missing free turn-by-turn navigation). I'm not certain how I will decide yet, and other people may make different choices - but that doesn't bother me.At the risk of perpetuating this debate, it does seem that commenters here are ignoring the graph showing the share of sales in the last 6 months:Not only are more Android-based phones selling than iPhones, but the rate at which they are selling faster than iPhones has increased over each of the last 4 months. While millions of people will switch to smartphones in the next few years, it seems (and research shown on MacRumors shows that it is) unlikely that most of them will be willing to pay the premium for an iPhone and expensive service plan.The battle over who will sell more is already over, but I don't think it is a battle Apple has been trying to win. The only way I can see for Apple to out-sell Android is to offer a cheaper range of phones but for the reason I mentioned above - little difference in features vs. Android phones - it is hard to see how they can do that without cannibalising their higher-end iPhone sales.Apple might be better off where it is, focusing on delivering the best and most consistent user experience - and leading the industry.</text>

	<text>I think people are putting too much 'hope' into the Verizon deal (if it ever comes). Yes, it will increase sales numbers. But other countries with the iPhone on multiple carriers have already shown that this is not enough to 'take over' the market. I love my iPhone, I think it's one of the best phones out there - other people have other preferences and might disagree, fine. The iPhone is also a very expensive phone (both to purchase and the contract), so not everyone can (or is willing) to pay that much (and many people just don't buy Apple). I also don't see the advantage of 'open' in Android - you are still locked into your provider and you never know if or when you will get the latest software update.For the market share: I think the only people that really care about this are blind Apple fans and Android fans that make more a religion out of this than anything else. I don't care - I but what I can effort and fits my needs. Except for some marketing purpose, I think those companies also don't care: Bottom line is how much money the make - and this is very Apple wins. They don't waste money by creating dozens of variations of the same thing and can streamline to support one design that they support. They sell it at a high price, but enough people are willing to pay that price to make it worth it - they don't need 99% market share to be profitable - they probably make with 15% share more money than all the others together.</text>

	<text>I see some of the people in the thread link you posted finding certain apps caused the battery drain. I also see some people were taking the phone back to Apple for a replacement. A replacement phone would be able to be restored. I don't see where a wipe and start over to be theonlysolution, in that thread you posted. Maybe it was for you.Back to my original statement ofthere is no way, that anyone can tell me, to fully restore the entire configuration from one android phone to another even when it is the exact same model.HTC stopped responding to my question and Sprint said it isn't possible. This is a pretty glaring over site IMO.As far as battery life the EVO is no picnic either, if I don't manage the apps that are running manually (yes there are apps for this some are free) it will suck the battery down pretty fast.Quote:Originally Posted byswagiTried that with my wife's iPhone 3GS.

	<text>Once the iphone is available in other carriers aside from At&amp;t, we'll see for sure if the trends change or not. Apple appears to cater mostly for less tech savvy users in their product lineups (you don't have to know how to count to ten to be able to use them). I don't see hordes upon hordes of angry average joes/janes complaining about the walled garden approach to their idevices. So in my opinion, geeks may hate it, but this appears to be the most profitable approach for Apple. It works, millions love it, and makes Apple obscenely huge piles of money.Add to that the recent report by DARPA stating science/engineering enrollments have dropped by 43% and we might predictably have a USA where the dumbs inherit the earth, people who would happily buy the iphone and not give a flying f*k whether iOS is open or not. The rapidly dwindling geek population could keep on harping that android is much better because it's &quot;open source&quot;; but it won't matter because they're voices would be drowned out by the sea of happy paying people who don't know and don't care.</text>

People also make the conscious choice of simple. I'd rather use a toaster than build a fire every morning to make toast. The fire iswaymore functional; for instance the toaster is useless for heating a pot of water or my room... but really I just want toast. I've gotten to the same point with my cell phone.Quote:Originally Posted bytetravusThe rapidly dwindling geek population could keep on harping that android is much better because it's &quot;open source&quot;; but it won't matter because they're voices would be drowned out by the sea of happy paying people who don't know and don't care.Not just geeks, general tinkering is on the decline. As a kid I used to disassemble everything to try and see how it worked, much to my parents chagrin. I worked on my bike. When I got old enough to drive I was working on my car every weekend. I don't see that desire in my own children, or their friends either. They are all good students... maybe I've failed to instill that in them.</text>

	<text>who's fault besides apple is it?  is it HTC's fault for selling to multiple carriers? is it samsung's fault for selling to multiple carriers? fact is android is outselling ios on phones period.  Apple had a chance to take this thing over completely and offer some different flavors and choices but failed.  can't talk about if's and when's when the now shows the truthlinkyQuote:Originally Posted by*LTD*Google is barely managing, with some 40+ Android iPhone copies (some of them pretty bad), to surpass Apple's one (or at most two) phone(s). And they've had practically forever to do it.THAT is the real story here.I'd hate to be a fly on the wall in Schmidt's office when the iPhone moves to other US carriers.I wonder if Eric throws chairs, too.</text>

Like they failed?Apple has the number one smartphone in the world.Apple is number one in smartphone revenue in the world.Apple is number one in mobile phone profits in the world.Apple is number one in smartphone sales in the US (on one carrier!)None of the trends show any of these changing anytime soon.</text>
