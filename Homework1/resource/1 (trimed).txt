	<text>Today, Intelannouncedtheir next generation processor architecture known as "Sandy Bridge" (or 2nd Generation Core processor).   The new processors are built on the 32nm process and integrate the processor, memory controller and graphics on the same die.  In particular the new integrated graphics performance is significantly improved over previous Intel's previous chips.TechReportsummarizes the changes:Sandy Bridge is, essentially, a next-generation replacement for Intel's primary CPUs for desktops and laptops .... At the heart of Sandy Bridge is an essentially new processor microarchitecture, the most sweeping architectural transition from Intel since the introduction of the star-crossed Pentium 4. Nearly everything has changed, from the branch predictors through the out-of-order execution engine and into the memory subsystem. The goal: to achieve higher performance and power efficiency, even on single-threaded tasks, where the integration of multiple CPU cores hasn't been much help.Anandtechin particular notes that the new processor architecture is a major step forward for laptops, significantly closing the price/performance gap between desktops and laptops.Also promising for Mac users is that they found the graphics performance generally exceeded that found in the NVIDIA 320M that is presently used in the MacBook and MacBook Airs inLow detail settings:Again, Sandy Bridge delivers playable performance in every single title at 768p and "Low" detail settings. What's more, it actually surpasses the GeForce 320M in Apple's MacBook Pro 13 in five out of six games (the exception being STALKER).Performance, however, didlagin Medium detail settings. Intel's previously poor integrated graphics performance was seen as one of the reasons why Apple has stuck with pairing of previous generation Intel processors and NVIDIA 320M GPUs.Overall,Anandtech is impressedwith the performance and battery life of the new chips:Not only do we get 50 to 100% better performance than the previous generation high-end Intel mobile chips, but we also get more than double the integrated graphics performance and battery life in most situations should be similar to Arrandale, if not better. And that's looking at the quad-core offerings!Meanwhile, dual core and low-power versions of Sandy Bridge processors are expected to arrive next month.</text>

	<text>I for one am deeply surprised that this IGP is faster than the current card. But honestly ... how fast is the current card? It seems like that the whole &quot;its 2011 thing&quot; would mean there are or will be dedicated cards out there faster than what is the one in the MB/Air.I mean.. didn't the 300 serious turn a year old last October? Or am I getting mixed up with some other GPU.</text>

	<text>No USB3 support from Intel, and all the quad cores are 45W parts. Unless Apple redesign the 15/17&quot; MacBook Pros, it looks like we're going to be stuck with dual core systems again. (the current design uses 35W chips)I really hope that we either get Light Peak (seems like we would have heard something about it by now though&#8230;) or that Apple uses a separate USB controller to get USB3 support.Considering that Steve said they don't plan on supporting USB3 at the end of October, it looks like we might be stuck with USB2. It was bad enough withlast year'supgrade not supporting USB3.Looks like the 13&quot; MBP will have 2.1/2.3GHz low voltage options. (I think the 13&quot; is limited to 25W TDP chips) At least they shouldfinallybe moving away from Core2.The boost in performance and efficiency seems great, but it looks like the next MBP refresh is probably going to disappoint a lot of people.

	<text>So... because the IGP is not in an actual Macintosh ... the rating of the IGP sucks? Sounds flawed. If anything, it would be Apple/Intel's falt for cruddy support on the driver (or whatever is need for a processor die IGP) and reflect nothing of the IGP's true performance.I believe it is faster than the 320M. But really, the 320M is pretty old now I think as of Jan 2 2011.</text>

	<text>The only thing holding these back is OpenCL support, which may or may not happen depending on if Intel can come up with a way to support either a CPU/GPU hybrid driver or if their new AVX instructions can speed up perf enough to make the GPU-based OpenCL unnecessary.The GPU perf is enough, though just barely. It beat the 320M in low detail/quality settings, and lost barely in medium settings, HOWEVER those were with a quad core CPU backing it up. If the performance degrades enough with a dual core CPU, then the Intel 3000 graphics may come out slower than the 320M. We wont know until February and the DC SNB chips start to show up.That said, we're definitely going to get an iMac upgrade - the new QC desktop S-series CPUs support 65W TDP - the current lower power QCs in the iMac are 75W or so. This will hopefully allow the lower end iMacs (22-23&quot;) to get real Core i-whatever QC CPUs instead of still running C2Ds. Now for pricing reasons the lower end iMacs could still get dual core chips, but even the DC SNB chips are 35W TDP rated so they will be put in there, and those same chips will likely end up in the Mac Mini as well.The only thing we'll have to wait a while for are the Macbook Air-compatible CPUs. (by compatible I mean in terms of voltage, heat, etc)Finally, the end of the Core 2-series of chips!</text>

	<text>Sandy Bridge would be a welcome addition to an Apple notebook. Remember that Apple can package a non-integrated chip on the motherboard as well as the Sandy Bridge CPU+IGP.OpenCL runs on heterogenous resources. It could run on the CPU and GPU or exclusively one. It's not really &quot;support&quot; they need to add, simply the driversOpenCL + DX11 on Sandy BridgeJust because this CPU isn't on a Mac running OS X doesn't mean it's unquantifiable.Macs run on the x86 platform, so it's not unreasonable to extrapolate information based on the reviews. It's not like this will for some reason be a terrible Hindenburg when OS X is ran on it. That's just outlandish.Also, for the IGP haters out there: just because _you_ need a super-powered discrete GDDR4 fizz-bobbing whizz-banger does not mean that everyone and their mother does. The Intel IGPs do not suck. They do a job. Let me see you write one?The AVX extensions themselves would be well worth it, if Lion gets support. I mean come on, doubled data path, increased operand limit and better SSE execution.Also, the improved branch-predictors and higher CPU caches are impressive.What may be more exciting though, is the Intel tock cycle with the 22nm Ivy Bridge. Entry-level quad core, &amp;c.As for USB3, it's not in H67/P67/P61 chipsets (though SATA3 is) but I really wouldn't worry about that right now.In the end of the day, a notebook computer with an IGP+Discrete combination is enough for most, and can still run games decently. As of yet, there's still no way to exact that much power from a notebook. However, it seems that the new architecture and subsystem including the OOE cycle and more, should be revolutionary enough.And finally: the CPU itself is a low priority bottleneck at the moment. SSDs can make your machine feel brand new, even with an older Core CPU.Relax! This processor isn't the end of the world.</text>

We shall see.  Three years is practically an eternity in technology nowadays.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byFlakiHD3000 is only leading by small margrin due to its CPU, which is better than MBP 13's c2d, which is bottlenecking 320m at lower res and settings.So in essence, the 320m is faster.The overall performance is what matters. You cannot use 320M with Sandy Bridge or other iX CPUs so we don't know how fast 320M would be with better CPU.</text>

It's getting harder and harder to justify buying Apple hardware these days. They just don't seem to care about performance any more.</text>

	<text>http://www.anandtech.com/show/4083/t...-2100-tested/7Quote:How about 23.976 fps playback? Sorry guys, even raking in $11 billion a quarter doesn&rsquo;t make you perfect.Here&rsquo;s the sitch, most movie content is stored at 23.976 fps but incorrectly referred to as 24p or 24 fps. That sub-30 fps frame rate is what makes movies look like, well, movies and not soap operas (this is also why interpolated 120Hz modes on TVs make movies look cheesey since they smooth out the 24 fps film effect). A smaller portion of content is actually mastered at 24.000 fps and is also referred to as 24p.In order to smoothly playback either of these formats you need a player and a display device capable of supporting the frame rate. Many high-end TVs and projectors support this just fine, however on the playback side Intel only supports the less popular of the two: 24.000Hz.and further down:Quote:How big of an issue this is depends on the user. Some can just ignore the judder, others will attempt to smooth it out by setting their display to 60Hz, while others will be driven absolutely insane by it.Great news...</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byKristennI believe it is faster than the 320M. But really, the 320M is pretty old now I think as of Jan 2 2011.It is marginally faster at Low settings and marginally slower at medium settings.Also, the Sandy Bridge GPU was tested in the Quad Core Sandy Bridge processor which has a graphics clock of 650Mhz/1300 (Turbo).  The Sandy Bridge i3 dual core processor which will likely go into the entry level 13&quot; macbook Pro that will clock lower at 650/1100Mhz.It get worse with the ULV Sandy bridge which clocks at 350/900Mhz.Another thing I just noticed is that the Quad Cores use DDR3-1600Mhz memory, which the dual cores use 1333Mhz memory which might benefit graphics performance (memory is shared between CPU and GPU).So overall, the graphics is marginally slower, but of course there a massive boost in CPU Power especially compared to Core 2 Duo.  Quite an impressive processor.</text>

	<text>Interesting point from Tom's hardware:&quot;I&rsquo;m also a big fan of Quick Sync. Neither AMD nor Nvidia have an answer to Intel&rsquo;s decode/encode acceleration, and they&rsquo;re not expected to any time soon. If you do a lot of video editing or transcoding, an upgrade to Sandy Bridge might be warranted based solely on the time you&rsquo;ll save by virtue of this feature. Kudos to Intel for getting developer support lined up right out of the gate, too. If the graphics guys could rally the software industry as quickly, we'd already be swimming in CUDA- and APP-accelerated titles.&quot;</text>

We're in 2011 and you still can't beat tech from 2009.  Sooooo impressive.Of course, when Apple puts this in a MacBook, watch all the &quot;Apple does no wrong crowd&quot; claim that &quot;it's faster in low settings!&quot;.Well, if this happens, this was my last MacBook unless I go with one with a dedicated GPU.Quote:Originally Posted byTechhieThe Intel/Nvidia dispute previously hindering Apple has been resolved, meaning that the next revision will likely feature another Nvidia-based chipset/discrete GPU combo.No it hasn't.  Intel has just refused to license nVidia to make chipsets for the new architecture and nVidia has bowed out of the chipset game.  Discrete/dedicated GPUs were never a problem, the chipset (memory controller/pci bus/sata controller/IGP) are and are never coming back.</text>

SSDs are getting there slowly but still expensive and limited in capacity.Intel is developing Light Peak, 10Gb/s, should be out later on this year. It's expected that it will replace or at least offer an alternative to Ethernet and other interfaces (USB, FireWire...).Intel should be releasing G3 SSDs within few months. 25nm manufacturing method should bring nice price cut, the current word is that 160GB will replace 80GB and 300GB will replace 160GB, along with new 600GB model. New tech always costs more in the beginning but wait few years and I bet SSDs will be fairly affordable.I would say Intel is trying to solve several issues but maybe it's just too much for one company. Broadband is limited by ISP and as you probably know, ISPs suck. However, some progress is being made in there too. At least here in Scandinavia, fibers are getting more and more popular and 200Mb/s (unlimited of course) costs roughly 50&#8364; per month.</text>

It just seems like we're solving the wrong problems here.I agree with you to a point. I wish we (in America) would deploy the kind of broadband speeds they have in Europe. I was blown away at the speeds they have up and down on another MR thread about posting your speed test results. I thought the fiber connection I have at work was fast, but compared to some in the old country, I may as well have been using a dialup modem.But Intel is doing what they do, develop processors, not hard drives or SSD's. As far as networking and bandwidth, it will take the whole industry to upgrade forklift style. Think of all the different router makers, switches, NIC's, etc... out there that need to start moving forward. I agree with you though, I wish we'd start moving faster on the networking side. Storage speed is finally getting a boost with the SSD market.</text>

	<text>While I really enjoy the possible MBP and MBA upgrades I can't help to feel thatneeds to catch up to the rest of the world in 3D support at the software level. I mean it is great to have more and more advanced GPU-s in integrated systems, but performance and GPU utilization in Mac OS X is clearly sub par. My Dad's &quot;ancient&quot; HP notebook with a Mobility 9200 runs Google Earth sometimes smoother than my Mac Pro under OS X at the same resolution. Pro apps don't even support GPU acceleration and the ones that do performance is underwhelming compared to Windows version of the equivalent software. My friend is a biologist who has trouble with CUDA acceleration for his sequencing application.is very late to the 3D game and ignorance won't help here as they might get away with Blu-RayI love the products but will have to reconsider Windows as my main workstation OS if this doesn't improve, and fall back to mac notebooks and IOS devices.

	<text>Does anyone think the new SB architecture will bring a noticeable performance boost to iMovie? I know it's [iMovie] is still 32 bit, but if Apple brings out iLife '12 next year with native 64 bit support, I hope iMovie and even FCP would gain a substantial boost.I frequently do 1 hour long videos and rendering sure takes a long time on my 3.06GHz C2D, 6GB RAM.</text>

	<text>I cannot consider these changes a real performance improvement. Intel graphic has always been bad and I don't like their marketing. To obtain similar graphic performances now we need a CPU such as i5 or i7. 13 MBP design could be considered obsolete, as it doesn't provide the extra space for a dedicated GPU in the sandy bridge architecture. Intel has won: consumers are forced to pay their low quality graphic cards even if they don't need them, and chipset competitors are out of the business.It's not a good piece of news.</text>

I suspect the improvements in GPU tech are always big at first and incremental later on.Intel needs to steal NVIDIA's low-end GPU lunch. At the moment the high end GPU tech (both graphics and the Fermi compute) is funded by this. A good enough solution at this stage will help Intel do this and slow the high end progress made by NVIDIA. They're not trying to appeal to most of us here who have higher expectations of the hardware. Most laptop users don't tax the GPU with their Facebook usage!The interesting question here is: where does this leave AMD and do they have a chance at a deal with Apple?

And this leads the same hardware to perform less powerful in OSX than a well-implemented OS, like windows. Mac users will have their GPU working on h.264 acceleration and full OpenGL 3.x support under bootcamp(windows). But same hardware will not perform the same under OSX.It's quite reasonable and logical to say we won't get the same performance jump in OSX, considering all the result we get is basing on windows, not OSX.</text>

It's been a slow and profitable development cycle for Intel moving from the FSB architecture to what they have now. Talk about milking to the max.I think they have been trying.  Intel just can't seem to get dense execution units right.  That is why the Atom and their GPU efforts have all been failures.  Both ARM chips and GPUs are mostly execution units with very little instruction scheduling logic.  Chips that need advanced instruction scheduling to execute a single stream of instructions as fast as possible seem to be the only thing Intel is good at.  Hopefully this is changing or it will probably kill Intel.  The future is parallel processing and making instruction scheduling as irrelevant as possible.  The only reason that isn't a reality is because our software isn't designed for that paradigm, but work that Apple is doing may make that a reality.  This has been predicted for the last couple decades, so it isn't like Intel should be unprepared.  It is the only obvious path after hitting the limits of current technology.  Honestly, I'm surprised that Intel is having such a hard time with this transition.  I guess you can't always just throw money at a problem.</text>

It's GPU is not programmable like the discrete GPUs in the nVidia GeForce 9400M and GeForce 320M.Intel still hasn't been able to develop programmable GPUs - which are required to run OpenCL.Instead, and very disappointingly, the Sandy Bridge Processors will use drivers which will allow the CPU to run OpenCL.OpenCL is suppose to run on BOTH the CPU and GPU, allowing both to multitask.  This allows significant acceleration of certain tasks such as video processing.  This allows significant acceleration of tasks since it can utilize the multiple processing units of modern GPUs.Sandy Bridge Processors will only have the CPU running OpenCL tasks.  The Sandy Bridge GPUs will be idle.This means they are going to be MUCH SLOWER running OpenCL dependent applications than a combination of Intel Processor PLUS discrete GPU - such as the nVidia GeForce 320M.This is one reason Apple decided to stick with the older Core2Duo processors plus GeForce 320M in the MacBook rather than stick an i3 CPU with integrated graphics like other PC makers.  The discrete graphics - plus OpenCL capabilities - just blasted the newer processors with integrated graphics - such as the i3 line.I am sorely disappointed in Intel. They are sorely lagging in GPU technology.Sure, some sites are happy that OpenCL just runs on the Sandy Bridge processors.  But they miss the point that if Intel's GPU was programmable, the Sandy Bridge processors would be so much faster than they are now.We're still waiting for an Intel Processor with an integrated programmable GPU that can run OpenCL in the GPU.Disappointing.</text>

Honestly, I'm surprised that Intel is having such a hard time with this transition.  I guess you can't always just throw money at a problem.They, like many others, have thrown a lot at this. They've been active with MPI, OpenMP, now OpenCL support. Not to mention Intel's Ct and early TBBapproaches.The problem here is that the clock speed free ride the software industry has been riding is over. No-one is that surprised but no-one really has this solved right now. Interesting the gaming and scientific/research sectors are most aware of this. Hence the drive from the research community for OpenCL/CUDA and whatever replaces MPI.Apologies for veering off topic here but this is all part of the picture for Intel right now.</text>

Some of us professional users would love to hit a 10 hour runtime.  You may also be able to use one chip for OpenCL and the other for graphics or combine them together for more power.  Offloading data from the CPU to an embedded GPU is probably much faster then offloading to a discrete GPU that can't share memory.  So (as someone who is not an expert) I would say that a discrete chip may be inferior for OpenCL.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byjameskattIntel's Sandy Bridge does not support OpenCL in their integrated GPU.  It's GPU is not programmable like the discrete GPUs in the nVidia GeForce 9400M and GeForce 320M.Intel still hasn't been able to develop programmable GPUs - which are required to run OpenCL.This is indeed the crux. As I say the Intel GPU, *at this stage* is just a spoiler for NVIDIA's low end GPU market.The other point we're missing here is that the GPU needs to be on the socket for future performance. The Intel/NVIDIA spat means that NVIDIA is likely unable to got that route (though some say their Transmeta purchase allows them a route in as they are now technically an x86 licensee).Intel would have this sown up if thy could just have better GPUs or had another plan. Hmmm say, Larrabee. Thing is, I suspect they're very delayed on this and this is giving them trouble as they have this current problem of non-performing integrated GPUs on the die.</text>

	<text>Intel bashing seems a little bit of a tradition.Yes the 320M still is a faster GPU and testing at lowest details (with the highest CPU impact) with a much faster CPU doesn't seem fair, but it is reasonable. That is IGP performance and for practical use SB means that you get pretty descent usable performance.Intel may have a bad track record in GPUs but Intel also always had loads of money and really produced great work if they wanted too. Core 2 Duo after Pentium 4 is one example. They just started the whole GPU stuff a few years ago. You cannot do this from one day to the next. A CPU architecture usually needs a few years till it is available and the SB GPU is the first GPU that comes from this new focus.The most noteworthy thing I think is the fact that this SB IGP is probably the best possible solution for Notebooks one can think of. It gets the speed from other things than the 320M and has a lot of fixed function units. That maybe bad for OpenCL and maximum programmability but it is very good for battery life. A lot of the performance comes not from many execution units but low cache latency and so on that means the performance per watt under load is probably a lot better.The direct connection to LLC aka L3 might also negate some of the fixed function problems. It is not a high performance GPU but it is designed to excel in its field. If someone needs massive GPGPU processing power and CPU + AVX etc. is not enough than he/she will use a dedicated GPU. Why design an IGP for anything but its intended purpose if it hurts battery life. Most people don't need OpenCL. They might need some encode acceleration and intel provided with 3sqmm chip space dedicated to that and it performs better than some high end GPU.It can do everything an average user needs at the lowest possible energy consumption. I'd say that makes it the perfect GPU for notebooks. Everything else just needs an additional dedicated GPU monster than can now even in quad core CPU be disabled to get great battery life.When you look at the whole energy consumption it sounds like it would be worth to do a small redesign and make 15&quot; and 17&quot; quad core compatible. The battery life could be advertised as the same but the performance would almost double. But history tells us Apple prefers the slim form to speed so it is not a very likely possibility. It would be a nice surprise.</text>

It's all about Ivy Bridge and the ULV Sandy Bridges due at the end of the year.The big question is what exactly does the rumoured settlement between NVIDIA and Intel look like?If the dual-core versions put out similar numbers and run OpenCL code decently, I think we can safely predict that Apple will go back to Intel integrated graphics with no discrete GPU for the 13&quot; MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air line.  A significant CPU boost and no appreciable difference to the 320M on graphics performance should lead to a nice upgrade.</text>

The low settings scenario in those 5 of out 6 games were probably CPU bound and the faster processor helped.  The actual GPU crown however goes to the 2009 GPU shipped by nVidia.Wow Intel, just wow.  We're in 2011 and you still can't beat tech from 2009.  Sooooo impressive.Of course, when Apple puts this in a MacBook, watch all the &quot;Apple does no wrong crowd&quot; claim that &quot;it's faster in low settings!&quot;.Splendid observation. If you take a MacBook, add a better CPU and a crappy GPU, you will get better results at low resolution and bad results at high resolution.Well, the Apple haters will either say &quot;why is Apple using last years CPU&quot;, &quot;why does Apple use crappy integrated graphics&quot;, or &quot;why is Apple using battery-eating discrete graphics&quot;. Or Apple offers three models, in which case they'll say &quot;why is Apple confusing consumers with three different models&quot;.Quote:Originally Posted bySpeedy2The HUGE issue however is that Intel has no proper OpenCL driver, and it's highly questionable if they'll be able to get a decent one out within a year. All the performance tests were done in Windows using DirectX.I suppose you are talking about OpenGL drivers here. Nobody cares whether some slow integrated Intel graphics supports OpenCL or not, unless they don't have a clue what OpenCL is for.</text>

It's GPU is not programmable like the discrete GPUs in the nVidia GeForce 9400M and GeForce 320M.Intel still hasn't been able to develop programmable GPUs - which are required to run OpenCL.Instead, and very disappointingly, the Sandy Bridge Processors will use drivers which will allow the CPU to run OpenCL.OpenCL is suppose to run on BOTH the CPU and GPU, allowing both to multitask.  This allows significant acceleration of certain tasks such as video processing.  This allows significant acceleration of tasks since it can utilize the multiple processing units of modern GPUs.Sandy Bridge Processors will only have the CPU running OpenCL tasks.  The Sandy Bridge GPUs will be idle.This means they are going to be MUCH SLOWER running OpenCL dependent applications than a combination of Intel Processor PLUS discrete GPU - such as the nVidia GeForce 320M.This is one reason Apple decided to stick with the older Core2Duo processors plus GeForce 320M in the MacBook rather than stick an i3 CPU with integrated graphics like other PC makers.  The discrete graphics - plus OpenCL capabilities - just blasted the newer processors with integrated graphics - such as the i3 line.I am sorely disappointed in Intel. They are sorely lagging in GPU technology.Sure, some sites are happy that OpenCL just runs on the Sandy Bridge processors.  But they miss the point that if Intel's GPU was programmable, the Sandy Bridge processors would be so much faster than they are now.We're still waiting for an Intel Processor with an integrated programmable GPU that can run OpenCL in the GPU.Disappointing.Now this sounds pretty much like all these postings, when Motorola dropped the ball on the G4. And when IBM dropped the ball on the PPC970 route.Who knows...maybe the A4 was Apple's first step in the right direction and hopefully they are using their newly acquired ARM-engineering experience to build a decent processor for use in desktops.I personally have the feeling that Apple is testing a full blown Mac OS X variant on ARM-procs and not relying on iOS alone. Hopefully we'll see something interesting evolving here.And I would greatly embrace when Apple would decide to use ARM processors...</text>

	<text>I have now read through the entire thread, and I must say that to my dissapointment not one of the posts mention the impact that this can be for the iMac.With both new processors out on the market and the new gfx cards from both nVidia and ATI out I think we will see a new iMac in the next 2 months. What is really enticing me is that we might actually get desktop graphics into the iMac. The new ATI cards use way less power than previous generation and these new cpus  looks nice. With a nice handeling of switching between the inegrated and the discreet gfx card this would also limit the total poweroutput and fan noise after what you are doing.I think this is more exciting than the update for the laptops, as the laptops are under the shadow of only getting intel integrated graphics again. except 15 and 17 will still continue to get discreet.I really hope apple will start using low midend discreet in the 13&quot; mbp line and finally get som highend gfx in the 15 and especially the 17&quot; model. I am tired of apple making the laptops thinner and thinner. I want power now, it is almost to thin as it is. And after all when it comes to portability it wont make a huge impact with 1&quot; more in thickness after all the width and depth will be the same limiting factor. The only thing that might matter is weight. though I would gladly choose 0.5kg heavier 17&quot; to get proper gfx soloutions.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bynilka;I have now read through the entire thread, and I must say that to my dissapointment not one of the posts mention the impact that this can be for the iMac.With both new processors out on the market and the new gfx cards from both nVidia and ATI out I think we will see a new iMac in the next 2 months. What is really enticing me is that we might actually get desktop graphics into the iMac. The new ATI cards use way less power than previous generation and these new cpus  looks nice. With a nice handeling of switching between the inegrated and the discreet gfx card this would also limit the total poweroutput and fan noise after what you are doing.I thought I read that, when a discrete GPU is connected to a PCI-E slot the IGPU is disabled. In the case of the iMac the ATI or NVidia GPU's are actually connected via PCI-E, the chip just happens to be soldered to the board and traces made directly to the controller. So i doubt there will be the switching you describe. To be clear tho I read this on the desktop SB articles, not sure if it is mentioned in the mobile articles. If you go to dailytech.com they have provide a list of SB articles some including the mobile versions.</text>

	<text>I think one exciting feature of Sandy Bridge (and Intel ecosystem) is new feature called Intel Insider. As I understand it provides better hardware based encryption which Hollywood trusts enough to allow streaming of movies in  1080p. At this time the details are rather sketchy.  Apple is not part of Intel announcement and an Apple spokesman declined to comment. It looks like Apple prefers to stick with iTunes and its 720p thus falling further and further behind from PC world in video world (first BlueRay, then AirPlay instead of DLNA, and now that)</text>

The software industry (outside of gaming) moves slowly, this is clear when watching this change from single to many-core.As has been pointed out NVIDIA have a stranglehold on compute right now with CUDA but expect OpenCL eventually overtake that lead. No-one likes lock into one vendor but CUDA brings the performance and ease of use right this minute. Oh, and marketing hype.</text>

But really, the 320M is pretty old now I think as of Jan 2 2011.Learn to read.  I'm reserving judgement on the new IGPS until they find their way into a shipping Macintosh and that shipping Macintosh is reviewed.  Nothing is final prior to that.Also the 320M is only a year old, nothing compared to how long Apple drew out use of the 9400M before switching to the former.</text>

Secondly, I care as to how it appears in a shipping Mac versus in its first official tech demo as things can change between now and then and Apple's implementation of the chips may change between now and then.  To say that drivers are the only difference and that its an inconsequential one is short-sighted.  It all affects final system performance when we finally get the Mac that ships with it in the mail.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byemotionYou'd be surprised....and wait until Lion - I expect extensive OpenCL use all over the place in the OS. By that point the software producers will be using it more widely too.The question is whether AVX and Sandy Bridge's dedicated media encoder is an acceptable alternative to OpenCL running on an nVidia IGP or low-end discrete GPU. The most common use case for GPGPU is video encoding, and Anand's benchmarks have shown that Sandy Bridge's dedicated media encoder is faster than even a GTX465M using CUDA which is more mature than OpenCL. In other words, lack of OpenCL GPGPU acceleration is in no way an impediment for Sandy Bridge's video encoding abilities. As for everything else, especially third-party software, it's much easier for them to transition existing code from SSE acceleration to AVX acceleration for a noticeable speedup than to rewrite code in OpenCL. The AVX speedup may not exceed what OpenCL can accomplish, but if it's easier to realize, I think that will be most beneficial for most users.EDIT: As an observation, it appears from Anand's review that Sandy Bridge brings noticable improvements in battery life where a quad core Sandy Bridge can get similar minutes of internet usage per MWhr of battery capacity as dual core Arrandale which is a significant improvement over Clarksfield quad cores. More likely than not, battery life concerns will be the primary factor in Apple deciding whether to go pure Sandy Bridge as opposed to Sandy Bridge + discrete GPU or Core 2 Duo + IGP or any other combination rather than GPU performance concerns for space constrained models like the 13.3&quot; units. In other words, much better CPU performance than Penryn Core 2 Duo, equivalent GPU performance as the 320M, and noticeable improvement in battery life seems like a compelling argument even if OpenCL support is quietly relegated to CPU support only. Apple will no doubt focus on the video encoding acceleration performance improvement anyways.</text>

It has to to bridge the gap between now and the commoditization of the Larrabee-derived Knights Corner/Ferry.I've not said anywhere that Sandy Bridge is of no use, or that AVX doesn't have some significance. My point is that Apple do focus on OpenCL and that has some bearing on when, and if, they adopt a hardware choice that doesn't accommodate that well.</text>

Intel has been in the graphics game since at least 1998, when they released the i740.  It was hyped as the &quot;fastests 3D accelerator yet!  Built with AGP support from the get-go!&quot;.  It was abysmal.13 years later, and they are still 2 years behind their competition.  nVidia has been shipping graphics processor since the NV-1 in 1995 and were behind 3Dfx until at least the Riva TNT chipset, which closed the gap, a mere 3 years after starting to make graphics.And let's talk about 3Dfx.  They shipped their first product in 1996.  They were instantly crowned king, having the best products and holding that position for quite a while.  Not bad for someone who has been at it for &quot;a short time&quot; and just went for nobodies to the best in &quot;one day to the next&quot;.Intel has gobs of money and engineering talent.  At this point, there is no excuse for them for their paltry showing in graphics technology.  They aren't investing what they need to be into it.</text>

I'm thinking that if AVX and OpenCL are both focused on providing enhanced vector processing capabilities to software, but in the near term AVX will see faster, broader adoption since companies can migrate their existing SSE codebase rather than developing a new OpenCL codebase, then it makes sense to push AVX first. For instance in a hypothetical component selection runoff between Sandy Bridge and AMD's Llano which has a Core 2 Duo level CPU and no AVX support although it has a fast IGP with OpenCL support, it probably makes sense to pick Sandy Bridge since most software can readily take advantage of the faster CPU and AVX rather than a few software than can take advantage of OpenCL.Quote:Originally Posted bybry223Wasn't the GMA 950 released like 5 years ago? The fact is every IGP release has seen very dismal performance gains.  The sandy bridge IGP is a prime example, a IGP that barely tries to stack up against a IGP that was released 2 years ago.Who really wants to play games at low settings? There's a lot of games you can play at medium with the 320m yet the sandy bridge IGP ALTHOUGH paired with a faster CPU is 26% slower than a 320m at medium settings? Screw intel and their lack of focus in their GPU sector.If you are saying every Intel IGP release has seen dismal performance gains, that really isn't true. Sandy Bridge doubles the IGP performance of Arrandale and Arrandale was pretty much 2 times faster than the previous HD4500. When measuring relative performance increases, Intel has been achieving consistent doubling of graphics performance which nVidia and AMD have not been able to achieve. The GTX580 is not 2 times faster than the GTX480, it's not even 50% faster. Neither is the HD6970 2 times faster than the HD5870. Admittedly, Intel isn't pushing the performance envelope. Although since the 320M is less than 1 year old, Intel isn't meeting a 2 year gap as you say.In terms of medium settings, from Anand's benchmarks, even though the 320M beats the HD 3000, it might not be that relevant since the 320M floats dangerously around the 30fps threshold, which is often considered as playable. So the 320M may not provide a worthwhile playing experience anyways at medium settings. It's too bad Anand didn't include the 320M in their extended game tests for more data points.Quote:Originally Posted byMaven1975Honestly, any Mac without a dedicated GPU should not carry the Pro name. Whats the point of the Pro name without it?Full voltage processors and aluminum seems to be the minimum requirement for Pro. Now if Pro meant IPS screens then that could make it worthwhile even without a dedicated GPU. Going IPS would probably cost more than a dedicated low-end GPU too.</text>

I wish we (in America) would deploy the kind of broadband speeds they have in Europe. I was blown away at the speeds they have up and down on another MR thread about posting your speed test results. I thought the fiber connection I have at work was fast, but compared to some in the old country, I may as well have been using a dialup modem.But Intel is doing what they do, develop processors, not hard drives or SSD's. As far as networking and bandwidth, it will take the whole industry to upgrade forklift style. Think of all the different router makers, switches, NIC's, etc... out there that need to start moving forward. I agree with you though, I wish we'd start moving faster on the networking side. Storage speed is finally getting a boost with the SSD market.Yeah, the problem in the States is infrastructure: our population density is much lower than in Europe, so there's a lot more fiber to deploy (and all the other associated hardware) before a new technology can get decent penetration.  I'm guessing that in at least some parts of Europe the infrastructure deployment is at least partly government-supported, too; here, we haven't been willing to do that sort of thing since rural electrification in the early 20th century.  There's some hope that heavily urban areas might achieve decent speeds in the not-too-distant future (Google is planning an experiment along those lines), but it's unlikely we'll ever catch up in general.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bycommander.dataThe question is whether AVX and Sandy Bridge's dedicated media encoder is an acceptable alternative to OpenCL running on an nVidia IGP or low-end discrete GPU. The most common use case for GPGPU is video encoding, and Anand's benchmarks have shown that Sandy Bridge's dedicated media encoder is faster than even a GTX465M using CUDA which is more mature than OpenCL. In other words, lack of OpenCL GPGPU acceleration is in no way an impediment for Sandy Bridge's video encoding abilities. As for everything else, especially third-party software, it's much easier for them to transition existing code from SSE acceleration to AVX acceleration for a noticeable speedup than to rewrite code in OpenCL. The AVX speedup may not exceed what OpenCL can accomplish, but if it's easier to realize, I think that will be most beneficial for most users.EDIT: As an observation, it appears from Anand's review that Sandy Bridge brings noticable improvements in battery life where a quad core Sandy Bridge can get similar minutes of internet usage per MWhr of battery capacity as dual core Arrandale which is a significant improvement over Clarksfield quad cores. More likely than not, battery life concerns will be the primary factor in Apple deciding whether to go pure Sandy Bridge as opposed to Sandy Bridge + discrete GPU or Core 2 Duo + IGP or any other combination rather than GPU performance concerns for space constrained models like the 13.3&quot; units. In other words, much better CPU performance than Penryn Core 2 Duo, equivalent GPU performance as the 320M, and noticeable improvement in battery life seems like a compelling argument even if OpenCL support is quietly relegated to CPU support only. Apple will no doubt focus on the video encoding acceleration performance improvement anyways.Tom's Hardware said that the video encoding/decoding hardware in SB is at least 1 year ahead of nvidia and AMD. intel had been working on it for over 5 years and only announced it last year.it might not play games very fast, but it outperforms the competition in tasks most people use computers for</text>

Since by any other benchmark than gaming, Sandy Bridge looks superior to Nehalem/Westmere much less Penryn. It seems contradictory.Besides, Sandy Bridge's IGP is looking more like a sidegrade from the 320M. It's faster at low settings, slower at medium settings but even that has a caveat that at medium settings in most of Anand's benchmarks Sandy Bridge and the 320M really tied since the 320M is just ~1fps faster, likely within their error range. And given the performance level of these IGPs, the games are most likely GPU-bound so going from a quad core Sandy Bridge to a dual core Sandy Bridge shouldn't change the results much.</text>

	<text>So if I'm reading the benchmarks correctly, if the new 13&quot; MBP gets the Sandy bridge treatment, we won't really see any big increases in gaming performance compared to the current models?Looking at the benchmarks, Sandy Bridge is using an i7 in these tests, and its gaming performance is more or less on par with the MBP C2D+320M inmedium performance.And somehow i doubt we'll see i7's in the entry level 13&quot; MBP, meaning the performance gains would be less if the 13&quot; MBP received an i3 for example (though it'd be a nice surprise if we did get an i7).)Regardless it looks like Intel's IGP will be the new bottleneck. Any hope we'll see an Nvidia or ATI GPU in the 13&quot;?</text>

The things that might be good enough for you aren't good enough for others and some people need more than a 1.4 GHz ULV C2D. People bitched when Apple stuck with C2D and now they're bitching about the fact that Apple is using Intel's graphics. Well ****, how long do you expect them to use C2D? I'll agree that Intel shouldn't have forced their graphics on everyone but that doesn't change the fact that they've now at least caught up to the performance of the 320M allowing Apple to use them with the new processors which is a good thing.The fact remains that you could be doing &quot;coding&quot; without the 320M just as easily on SB graphics. Only it would be faster because of the better processor. You complain about the fact that we are comparing it to a 1 year old 320M, well you bought the MBA two to three months before Sandy Bridge was out so I don't see what the issue is? It's a three month difference of similar performance that you purchased. If you bought it because it meets your needs then that's fine and dandy but don't rag on Intel's IGP just to justify your purchase when in reality Intel has actually done a pretty good job here. Apple can now finally use modern CPU's in all of their machines.</text>

Ignore the rest of my post because you know I'm right. You enjoy the 320M for the occasional game, well guess what... the three month difference of Sandy Bridge can game just as well as the 320M, and now that you say that you game there is a need for a better processor, ex,  the Source engine is optimized for multi-threading and stronger processors. So either way you try to spin it, it still remains that SB can game just as well as your current machine with a two to three month difference.Quote:Originally Posted byslattery69isnt this a bit short sighted though great for existing users but how does this get new users into macs.im looking to get a new laptop next year and was considering getting another macbook , but i game every now and then and this could affect my decision, there will be plenty of other people whove bought into ipods, iphone ipads etc who may consider macs as there next system.if apple do go with a IGP it would satisfy many of there existing customer but would it bring in new ones ?The IGP will be enough to game on, the majority of people on Macs who game are using a 9400M, which Intel's IGP easily beats out. Also, yes it would bring in new customers because people wouldn't but the 13&quot; MBP when it still had a Core 2 Duo no matter how great the graphics were. All they wanted was a new Intel I-Series processor for the most part.</text>

You bought it, bro, so clearly you bought the machine that's &quot;right for you&quot; and will last with what you need it to do. If SB isn't adequate for you then neither is that 320M.Also how do you know that Apple won't put a discrete GPU in the 13&quot; MBP or even the 13&quot; MB? If they remove the optical drive then they could easily fit a discrete GPU in there. As for the &quot;what they shipped in the past was adequate&quot; quote, what they shipped in the past was a GMA 950, an X3100, a 9400M and a 320M, all of which were not the greatest options they could have gone with at the time.</text>

The chips that would go into a laptop would only have the 2000 version at half the speed.Quote:Originally Posted byKPOMMerom/Core 2 was actually Yonah+x64.  Pentium M chips were 32-bit only.  Yonah itself was modified Pentium III.  Basically, Intel realized that Apple/IBM/Motorola were right about CPU performance being more than clock speed, and abandoned the Pentium 4 platform.There was the time when Intel management told their hardware designers to increase Megahertz at any cost. Doesn't matter how _fast_ the processor was, as long as the clock is high. And then people would buy a 3200 MHz P4 chip thinking it was fast - when it wasn't. And then AMD responded by giving its chips numbers like &quot;AMD 3200&quot; - and people would buy them because it was the same number as the Intel chip! What they didn't realise was that at the time and &quot;AMD 3200&quot; would run at maybe 2000 MHz, not 3200 - the 3200 was just an arbitrary number. On the other hand, the AMD 3200 running at 2000 MHz would probably outrun the Pentium 4 at 3200 MHz :-) Why make a chip with a meaningless high clock speed when you can have the same effect on sales by just giving it a meaningless high number?</text>

Apple has never waited longer than 10 months to update the MBPs; last time they updated them was in April (not counting the small BTO option added a few months ago), so that means February at the latest. (Hopefully)Current signs seem to point to a likely February '11 MBP refresh update announcement with SB, but for now fingers should still be crossed.Quote:Originally Posted bymsciceVery nice news that it's out, but honestly i think we all saw it coming... however the question you have to ask yourself isWhat's the point in upgrading when Ivy Bridge will be released end of this year?Soo I mean i don't know yet if i will buy a new MBP, Im still on a Early 2008 model.I think if you're in that group you'd be better off just waiting for Ivy Bridge to debut in late 2011/early2012 before looking to upgrade your current system. But if you got an older system than the 2008 models then why not take the SB plunge now?Quote:Originally Posted byalent1234the graphics may not be killer graphics, but according to Anand's battery tests a test laptop with a 17&quot; screen killed a 13&quot; MBP in battery life.If that's true, that's something to really look forward to.Quote:Originally Posted bydrayonYes yes, SB is a simple and minor augmentation to the previous architecture. It's been a slow and profitable development cycle for Intel moving from the FSB architecture to what they have now. Talk about milking to the max.Quote:Originally Posted byHellhammer...People will whine no matter what Apple does, that's a fact.Quote:Originally Posted byun.titledIt's sad that a $499 Acer laptop will have this months before the $2000 MBP.Quote:Originally Posted byLarryCThere are three types of lies.1.

That was painful.I'm wondering what everyone will be doing on the MBP forum now, waiting for the new SB architecture to come out....  I'm still too traumatized to go back in there and find out!I certainly don't begrudge your skepticism.Quote:Originally Posted bycoder12Sandy Bridge? Who the heck is naming these? Why not just call it Wet Dog or something?Quote:Originally Posted byfun173sandy bridge sounds like something you would find on urban dictionaryQuote:Originally Posted byjamesryanbellIf you just bought a Macbook Pro, I want this thread to be the reason that you should have waited.Just assume that this will be the biggest update ever, and that you'll miss it.All of these are hilarious!Quote:Originally Posted byRichard1028We're screwed.I'm convinced there will be no discrete graphics in the 13&quot; MBP. Intel is applying tons of lipstick on the Sandy Bridge IGP and Apple will spin it even further.By the time Steve talks about it the new MBP13 will even wipe your arse.&quot;Bend over... Boom! There, you're done!&quot;Well said!Quote:Originally Posted byEnvI'm totally lost here too. Iv read the whole thread, so is it worth sticking around for these sandy bridge processors, or get what's on offer now and maybe upgrade again at ivy bridge, gonna be doing some fairly heavy audio editing?If you can wait, then why not?

	<text>Earlier in the thread, someone mentioned ARM as a threat... Here's some baseless speculation:If Apple used their iPad SSD experience to come up with the new MB Air with it's non-2.5&quot; SSD storage... And Lion is bringing lessons from iOS back to the Mac... What's stopping them from doing something genius/crazy like adding an A4 processor to each laptop, providing (a) iOS compatibility in OS X, and (b) a chip which can take some of the heavy lifting away from the Intel IGP and CPU. Kind of like Altivec for the PPC, I guess.My iPad decodes H.264 without getting hot or sluggish and the code has already been written for a lot of this stuff.I just think that the Intel parts will be downgraded to being a (large) piece of the Mac platform at some point in the future, and everything I see regarding their huge leaps forward (sarcasm intended) says to me that they will only last so long, just like 680x0 and PPC.</text>

Nice purchase.The fact remains that you are trashing Intel for their graphics matching that of a NEW machine you purchased two months ago that's still being sold. Also what arguments have you even had? All you have done is criticize the fact that the Sandy Bridge IGP matches the performance of the 320M and I found it INCREDIBLY ironic that you are saying this from a machine that has a 320M that was purchased literally a couple of months ago that also has a two year old processor in it. Also you want to talk about constant badgering? Nearly every thread on the front page of MacRumors I see you having a 12 page argument with.

However, when it comes time to upgrade it, sidegrading won't be an option and thus the Intel graphics that are a big sidegrade (even less so, seeing how other benchmarks show the SB IGP to be between a 310M and 320M for performance on tests that aren't CPU bound) won't be an option then.Not to mention OpenCL support is still a big mystery (software based OpenCL really defeats the purpose of using a language that lets you offload tasks to the GPU).This will be the last post in regards to my MBA.

	<text>I have one of the pre-release Sandy Bridge 32 nm. processor PC laptops (first ones were months back in Malaysia and Singapore) and the graphics, though integrated, are good enough for low end, and some mid-level stuff.From other forums and some mixed reviews, it handles stuff like iMovie level video (simple video editing programs) and most Adobe CS tasks, and it's surprisingly good for so-called &quot;Intel&quot; integrated graphics.The Sandy Bridge integrated graphics stand somewhere in between 45 nm generation integrated chip graphics and the nVidia/ATI stuff from 2010, but somewhat closer to the latter.While some will diss Intel for what were a bad history of &quot;integrated&quot; Intel graphics have to try out a 32 nm. Intel chip with graphics chipset and judge for themselves.That being said, a 2010 MBP with Intel Core 2 Duo paired with a dedicated graphics card is still somewhat better than Sandy Bridge alone, but not as much as one would think.</text>

It's the overall performance because you can't get a 320M on anything better than a C2D. Oh and the 320M BARELY beat out the SB IGP on the medium settings in most games where the SB IGP was in one game had a 15 frame increase. Calling it a PoS when it stacks up to the 320M quite favorably (which Apple is still selling in some capacity in 4 of their 6 computer models) is hilarious. So are you now calling the 320M a PoS? The fact is that you said that the SB IGP was gonna suck and it doesn't so now you're biting your tongue and trying to dig yourself out of the whole you dug yourself in.Quote:Originally Posted byVal-kyrieOnly on low settings; on medium settings, NVidia 320M outperforms Intel in 5 of the 6 games.Read the thread.

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byandrewfeeNo USB3 support from Intel, and all the quad cores are 45W parts. Unless Apple redesign the 15/17&quot; MacBook Pros, it looks like we're going to be stuck with dual core systems again. (the current design uses 35W chips)I really hope that we either get Light Peak (seems like we would have heard something about it by now though&hellip;) or that Apple uses a separate USB controller to get USB3 support.Considering that Steve said they don't plan on supporting USB3 at the end of October, it looks like we might be stuck with USB2. It was bad enough withlast year'supgrade not supporting USB3.Looks like the 13&quot; MBP will have 2.1/2.3GHz low voltage options. (I think the 13&quot; is limited to 25W TDP chips) At least they shouldfinallybe moving away from Core2.The boost in performance and efficiency seems great, but it looks like the next MBP refresh is probably going to disappoint a lot of people. (myself included)Unless Apple surprises me, I think I will plan to purchase my next Mac when Ivy Bridge comes out at the end of 2011. Hopefully then there will be USB 3 support, Blu Ray support, and 35W quad-cores at the new 22nm process. [edit: oh, and OpenCL support in the Intel IGP]Quote:Originally Posted byAnalog KidHas anyone heard Anandtech say something negative about a new Intel release?Nope. When I read the article, I wondered to myself if there isn't some kind of funding/perks they receive for their overwhelmingly positive press statements on behalf of Intel, especially when anandtech touts the Intel 3000 IGP despite its poor showing in games on anything above minimum settings. This may be progress for Intel, but it is barely enough for anything other than basic word documents, internet surfing, and watching videos.Quote:Originally Posted bytwcbcMac users will have their GPU working on h.264 acceleration and full OpenGL 3.x support under bootcamp(windows).Interestingly, it was an OpenGL game (Stalker 2, IIRC) that the Intel 3000 IGP was unable to run. I am not optimistic about Intel's IGP with regard to OpenGL support.Quote:Originally Posted byjameskattIntel's Sandy Bridge does not support OpenCL in their integrated GPU.  It's GPU is not programmable like the discrete GPUs in the nVidia GeForce 9400M and GeForce 320M.Intel still hasn't been able to develop programmable GPUs - which are required to run OpenCL.Instead, and very disappointingly, the Sandy Bridge Processors will use drivers which will allow the CPU to run OpenCL.OpenCL is suppose to run on BOTH the CPU and GPU, allowing both to multitask.  This allows significant acceleration of certain tasks such as video processing.  This allows significant acceleration of tasks since it can utilize the multiple processing units of modern GPUs.Sandy Bridge Processors will only have the CPU running OpenCL tasks.  The Sandy Bridge GPUs will be idle.This means they are going to be MUCH SLOWER running OpenCL dependent applications than a combination of Intel Processor PLUS discrete GPU - such as the nVidia GeForce 320M.This is one reason Apple decided to stick with the older Core2Duo processors plus GeForce 320M in the MacBook rather than stick an i3 CPU with integrated graphics like other PC makers.  The discrete graphics - plus OpenCL capabilities - just blasted the newer processors with integrated graphics - such as the i3 line.I am sorely disappointed in Intel. They are sorely lagging in GPU technology.Sure, some sites are happy that OpenCL just runs on the Sandy Bridge processors.  But they miss the point that if Intel's GPU was programmable, the Sandy Bridge processors would be so much faster than they are now.We're still waiting for an Intel Processor with an integrated programmable GPU that can run OpenCL in the GPU.Disappointing.Well spoken. Thanks.</text>

Now Apple can use modern processors in all of their machines. Won't be any different than when the processor got the shaft last refresh. Did the 2010 13&quot; MBP out perform the 2009 model in CPU intensive tasks? Hardly noticeable. The GPU was better though. So now it will be the processor that gets the boost while also increasing battery life even more than what it was before.Although at this point we don't even know what Apple could do if they removed the optical drive.

All the games tests are likely GPU bound.  Therefore a drop of 20% in GPU frequency will likely drop frame rates by a similar amount.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byevilcatEarlier in the thread, someone mentioned ARM as a threat... Here's some baseless speculation:If Apple used their iPad SSD experience to come up with the new MB Air with it's non-2.5&quot; SSD storage... And Lion is bringing lessons from iOS back to the Mac... What's stopping them from doing something genius/crazy like adding an A4 processor to each laptop, providing (a) iOS compatibility in OS X, and (b) a chip which can take some of the heavy lifting away from the Intel IGP and CPU. Kind of like Altivec for the PPC, I guess.My iPad decodes H.264 without getting hot or sluggish and the code has already been written for a lot of this stuff.I just think that the Intel parts will be downgraded to being a (large) piece of the Mac platform at some point in the future, and everything I see regarding their huge leaps forward (sarcasm intended) says to me that they will only last so long, just like 680x0 and PPC.Indeed plus the A5 should be a boast on that again so it's not at all strange to think of it driving full screen Safari, Mail, iTunes, iPhoto without ever firing up the CPU, then only kicking in the CPU as needed by code or demand. The big issue here is that it would probably need a whole lot of OS support to do it and these machines are pre Lion. I think this is what Lion is going to make possible.So maybe the Air3 will be a combo A5+i5ulv at the end of the year. While it would be cool I can't see it this round.Still other stuff from the iPad and ARM systems is you get an thumb nail sized CPU package jam packed on to a tiny motherboard. Compare that to the current MacbookPro motherboards and each of the chips has this massive carrier around it for the 1000+ pins. I mean Nvidia 320m and 330m have carriers the same size yet the 320m is a whole IO hub with pins with all the different IO devices. Does a GPU really need all that space?Couldn't nVidia or ATI/AMD sell a GPU packaged with RAM like the A4 and most ARM systems are. Same with Intels IO hub surely it has a lot of pins that just aren't going to used in a laptop, and some that are going to used to connect to others chips on the board which could be packed in to save space.Yes i know it all really comes down to heat but if you free up space you should be able to deal with more heat.</text>

In most cases, it won't achieve that but when under full load, it might. The current CPUs Apple uses are 35W and AFAIK Apple has always used 35W CPUs. It's likely that Apple would have to improve the cooling system in order to dissipate 45W from the CPU.Dual cores will be available early next month so IMO your point about availability is nonsense, it doesn't make it more likely that Apple will use quad. Quad core would be high-end only anyway due to price so Apple will have to wait for the dual core CPUs before they can refresh the MBP.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byasdf542Oh hey, if it isn't the man himself who tried to defend his claim by saying that you were waiting for the Mac OS X benchmarks.Again, the processor performance doesn't matter. It's the overall performance because you can't get a 320M on anything better than a C2D. Oh and the 320M BARELY beat out the SB IGP on the medium settings in most games where the SB IGP was in one game had a 15 frame increase. Calling it a PoS when it stacks up to the 320M quite favorably (which Apple is still selling in some capacity in 4 of their 6 computer models) is hilarious. So are you now calling the 320M a PoS? The fact is that you said that the SB IGP was gonna suck and it doesn't so now you're biting your tongue and trying to dig yourself out of the whole you dug yourself in.First and foremost, &quot;Hole&quot; and &quot;Whole&quot;, though one has a &quot;W&quot; in front of it, the two have entirely different meanings.  I'd tell you to look it up, but I think I've been mean enough about it.Secondly, I'm digging myself out of no such HOLE.  I don't know how many computers (not just Macs) that you've used with any sort of Intel based graphics.  I, myself have had the pleasure (torture) of using four of them, one Intel Mac mini, one MacBook, a Toshiba Satellite, and an Asus Eee PC NetBook.  For the Netbook, I can justify use of those graphics, for the other three machines, performance IS pitiful.  This is why when reading this announcement cold (i.e. not looking up benchmarks) I'm skeptical that any IGP from Intel is going to be even remotely passable as an IGP.  Having seen the 9400M and then 320M from NVIDIA, I'm actually confident that while still paling in comparison to a dedicated GPU, IGPs don't have to suck THAT hard.  This is why I'm skeptical and still reserve final judgement until I see a Mac model with one with which to compare the difference.  From the sounds of it, there is no OpenCL on the IGP half of Sandy Bridge yet, so I doubt it'll end up in a shipping Mac without a dedicated GPU ANYWAY, given Apple's vested interest in it.Regardless, the fact that the Sandy Bridge IGP only came close to beating the 320M on the medium settings of the games is rad.  Though, you're still telling me that it's a step backwards, albeit a small one.  You're also telling me that Sandy Bridge's IGP needed its CPU half to best the GeForce 320M running on a Core 2 Duo.  I'm assuming that Sandy Bridge's IGP beats the living crap out of the GeForce 9400M (regardless of what CPU is running in tow) and if Apple had never gone with the 320M, I'd have no qualms about transitioning to this clearly better IGP and finally moving away from the already older-than-needed mobile Core 2 Duo CPUs.  However, it's sounding like if I'm to have Sandy Bridge at all, it's to be on a 15&quot; MacBook Pro where I won't have to rely on (once again) sub-par Intel graphics.Woo Hoo, they came ALMOST close to beating it on the settings that count!  It should be blowing the GeForce 320M clear out of the water in every setting; it should be as radical of a jump in performance as going from the GMA X3100 to the GeForce 9400M was or as radical as the jump from the GeForce 9400M to the GeForce 320M.  To Intel's credit, that is further than they've ever come before in terms of IGP performance, but that's still pitiful, I'm sorry.</text>

It just doesn't.The CPU and GPU aren't as different as you may think. Do a little research.How much of a decrease do you expect?  From your post it seems you expect no decrease at all.I think you should do some research.  I said if the bottleneck if of the game is GPU speed, then a 20% decrease in GPU speed will likely decrease a similar amount in frame rate.Check the desktop review where they review the IGP with different frequencies.  There are quite a few games in there that decrease their frame rate by over 15%.http://www.anandtech.com/show/4083/t...2100-tested/11So what is the conclusion?320M+core 2 duo is approx 5% faster than highly clock Intel IGP in i7 Quad mobile (medium settings).  This result is not relevant since the macbook Pro 13&quot; will not get a i7 quad core chip.320M+core 2 duo would be around 15-20% faster than lower clocked Intel IGP in i3 Dual core mobile which the 13&quot; macbook pro will likely get.320M+ core 2 duo &gt; 20% faster than even lower clocked Intel IGP in i5/i7 ULV Dual core mobile in Macbook Air.</text>

The reason the MBA uses blade SSD's is because of how thin it is. A standard SSD would not fit inside. The MBP can easily fit a standard SSD in the chassis. If anything using blade SSD's would have a negative impact on the MBP because it would decrease the maximum potential storage space. Intel will be releasing 600GB SSD's this quarter.</text>

Such is the shame of itAt what point in time did Apple actually decide as a company they would always be seen as the company that used low end graphics. It's ruined their chances for years and years against the PC, where if they had chosen a different path they would have been right up there at the top.It's just a shame.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bythunng8How much of a decrease do you expect?  From your post it seems you expect no decrease at all.I think you should do some research.  I said if the bottleneck if of the game is GPU speed, then a 20% decrease in GPU speed will likely decrease a similar amount in frame rate.Check the desktop review where they review the IGP with different frequencies.  There are quite a few games in there that decrease their frame rate by over 15%.http://www.anandtech.com/show/4083/t...2100-tested/11You just don't get it do you dude? I'll repeat myself one more time for you, maybe you'll get it this time. A 20% drop in clock speed alone does not correlate to a 20% drop in overall performance. It doesn't. Get over it. It would be closer to something of 5% if anything. Not 20%.Oh and thanks for the link, you just proved my point. The difference in the majority of those is miniscule.Quote:Originally Posted byYebubblemanFirst and foremost, &quot;Hole&quot; and &quot;Whole&quot;, though one has a &quot;W&quot; in front of it, the two have entirely different meanings.  I'd tell you to look it up, but I think I've been mean enough about it.It's called being awake for over 24 hours, you miss things when you are proofreading. I don't even know why you're commenting on this.Quote:Secondly, I'm digging myself out of no such HOLE.  I don't know how many computers (not just Macs) that you've used with any sort of Intel based graphics.  I, myself have had the pleasure (torture) of using four of them, one Intel Mac mini, one MacBook, a Toshiba Satellite, and an Asus Eee PC NetBook.  For the Netbook, I can justify use of those graphics, for the other three machines, performance IS pitiful.  This is why when reading this announcement cold (i.e. not looking up benchmarks) I'm skeptical that any IGP from Intel is going to be even remotely passable as an IGP.  Having seen the 9400M and then 320M from NVIDIA, I'm actually confident that while still paling in comparison to a dedicated GPU, IGPs don't have to suck THAT hard.  This is why I'm skeptical and still reserve final judgement until I see a Mac model with one with which to compare the difference.  From the sounds of it, there is no OpenCL on the IGP half of Sandy Bridge yet, so I doubt it'll end up in a shipping Mac without a dedicated GPU ANYWAY, given Apple's vested interest in it.No, in the beginning of this thread you were trying to make the claim that they were going to suck. All I did was reply with benchmarks that showed it didn't suck and you went ape **** trying to say how you were waiting for OS X benchmarks.Quote:Regardless, the fact that the Sandy Bridge IGP only came close to beating the 320M on the medium settings of the games is rad.  Though, you're still telling me that it's a step backwards, albeit a small one.  You're also telling me that Sandy Bridge's IGP needed its CPU half to best the GeForce 320M running on a Core 2 Duo.  I'm assuming that Sandy Bridge's IGP beats the living crap out of the GeForce 9400M (regardless of what CPU is running in tow) and if Apple had never gone with the 320M, I'd have no qualms about transitioning to this clearly better IGP and finally moving away from the already older-than-needed mobile Core 2 Duo CPUs.  However, it's sounding like if I'm to have Sandy Bridge at all, it's to be on a 15&quot; MacBook Pro where I won't have to rely on (once again) sub-par Intel graphics.I don't really understand the mentality? Anyone who has purchased a machine with a 320M has done so in one year. Do you people honestly upgrade right after they release another revision? Anyone who should be looking to upgrade older machines that have a 9400M or worse should be looking at an improvement, and those that did have a machine with a 320M won't be looking at that much of a difference but will get the added benefits of having a better processor, longer battery life, etc. if they decide to upgrade. Even with that said no one knows what Apple will do if they remove the optical drive. They could very well fit a discrete GPU in the 13&quot; MB/MBP if they wanted to and leave the Air with SB IGP by itself. Hell, next time they update the Air Ivy Bridge might be close to release.Quote:Woo Hoo, they came ALMOST close to beating it on the settings that count!  It should be blowing the GeForce 320M clear out of the water in every setting; it should be as radical of a jump in performance as going from the GMA X3100 to the GeForce 9400M was or as radical as the jump from the GeForce 9400M to the GeForce 320M.  To Intel's credit, that is further than they've ever come before in terms of IGP performance, but that's still pitiful, I'm sorry.No one is arguing that a new NVIDIA solution wouldn't be better. But that's not possible right now so this is good enough for Apple to use modern processors. That's all I'm saying.</text>

The period between last two updates has been a year and couple of months so Q4 2011 would fit in Apple's update pattern too, and it would keep the Mac Pro as &quot;pro&quot; level machine by utilizing the high-end chipset and CPUs, rather than mainstream LGA 1155 parts (though performance may be the same with two similarly specced CPUs).</text>

I'm perfectly open to being proven wrong, but so far I've yet to be save on specs that show me that Intel still can't do what they should be doing.  They're not falling as short as they have been, I'll grant them that.  And it looks like, as you said, customers upgrading from a GeForce 9400M based Mac to one of these won't be at all disappointed.  Rad.Quote:Originally Posted byasdf542I don't really understand the mentality? Anyone who has purchased a machine with a 320M has done so in one year.

How do you sell &quot;slightly less graphics&quot;?  For MacBook, Mac mini, and MacBook Air customers, they probably won't care.  For 13&quot; MacBook Pro customers?  Apple already had to defend the decision to stick with a Core 2 Duo on that model in favor of the 320M and that reason was for better graphics.  Clearly they care more about the lower-end machines having better graphics than CPU.  Toward that end, I won't argue against the notion that Sandy Bridge wouldn't be absolutely acceptible for the white MacBook, MacBook Air, or Mac mini; I'm sure it'd be fine (assuming Apple's need for OpenCL was satisfied), but I can assure you, that kind of performance isn't gonna fly on the 13&quot; MacBook Pro, and if it does, Apple won't hear the end of it.Quote:Originally Posted byasdf542No one is arguing that a new NVIDIA solution wouldn't be better. But that's not possible right now so this is good enough for Apple to use modern processors. That's all I'm saying.Good enough on every low-end Mac save for the 13&quot; MacBook Pro.  Otherwise, I agree with you; though I'd think they'd almost be better off switching to AMD.  At least their IGPs are consistently decent.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byYebubblemanApple's marketing tends to compare the new product to the one it is immediately replacing.  How do you sell &quot;slightly less graphics&quot;?  For MacBook, Mac mini, and MacBook Air customers, they probably won't care.  For 13&quot; MacBook Pro customers?  Apple already had to defend the decision to stick with a Core 2 Duo on that model in favor of the 320M and that reason was for better graphics.  Clearly they care more about the lower-end machines having better graphics than CPU.  Toward that end, I won't argue against the notion that Sandy Bridge wouldn't be absolutely acceptible for the white MacBook, MacBook Air, or Mac mini; I'm sure it'd be fine (assuming Apple's need for OpenCL was satisfied), but I can assure you, that kind of performance isn't gonna fly on the 13&quot; MacBook Pro, and if it does, Apple won't hear the end of it.Simple, they do the same thing they did last time only swap the position the processor was in with the graphics. Put the emphasis on the processor and the battery life like they did last refresh by putting the emphasis on the graphics and the battery life.Again, as for the 13&quot; Pro, Apple has multiple options open to them. They can either remove the optical drive and fit a discrete GPU in there or they can replace the 13&quot; MB with the 13&quot; Pro and leave the MacBook Pro line with what it used to be, the 15&quot; and 17&quot;. Many people argued that they should've removed the Pro name last refresh for sticking with Core 2 Duo. The next refresh likely won't be any different only the hate will be put on the graphics instead of processor.Quote:Originally Posted bythunng8Did you even read the link?  Half the games lost more than 15% of the frame rate. I don't know what your motive is, but you are flat out wrong.Uhh, did you read the link? The 20% difference in turbo boost clock speed proved that the performance was not 20% worse. Again, we are talking on clock speed alone here. How many times do I have to repeat myself?</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bygkarrisAren't people reading the fact that it beat nVidia in the LOW graphics mode...I think with inflation going to be the big thing in 2011, Apple will need to maintain margins without raising already premium prices. So, to keep the MacBook at $999 and Mini at $699, a processor with Intel Graphics &quot;good enough&quot; for iLife and Quicktime 720p (ha, ha, no Blu-ray so why 1080?) will work just fine...flame on...intel graphics on SB will beat blu ray and 1080p video playback on any nvidia or AMD GPU</text>

About 15% loss.You said there would be no loss.  That is flat out wrong.Given that the high end Intel GPU is already behind the 320M at medium settings (6%), the lower end intel one would fall even further behind.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byasdf542The difference between the 2500K and the 2600K in the majority of those games was not 15%, buddy.Quite obvious because the IGP in both runs at 850MHz. i7 has higher Turbo but remember that the stated Turbo istheoretical maximum, it may never reach that. It's rather unlikely that it will reach that stated clock speed from what I've heard about the CPU Turbo.In most cases, they will both likely run at around the same clock speed, making the difference between them negligible.</text>

Put the emphasis on the processor and the battery life like they did last refresh by putting the emphasis on the graphics and the battery life.I don't think they'll have it go down quite like that.  Apple cares more about graphics than they do CPU.  The vast majority of Apple's white MacBook, MacBook Air, and Mac mini customers will care just as little about Sandy Bridge's IGP as they would about the continued use of Core 2 Duos.  It's for the customers of the 13&quot; Pro that use of the Core 2 Duo becomes problematic.Quote:Originally Posted byasdf542Again, as for the 13&quot; Pro, Apple has multiple options open to them.

Many people argued that they should've removed the Pro name last refresh for sticking with Core 2 Duo. The next refresh likely won't be any different only the hate will be put on the graphics instead of processor.They will probably nix the 13&quot; Pro altogether.  They could (a) Switch to AMD for both processors and IGPs, but that'd be too drastic to solve just one model's problems (unless they have larger plans with AMD), or (b) nix the 2.5&quot; Hard Drive bay and use the MacBook Air's SSDs, using the reclaimed room for the GPU (that's all they'd need); too many &quot;Pro&quot; customers still, believe it or not, have use for the optical drive.  But if they don't do either, then there's no reason to keep it in the line.Quote:Originally Posted byalent1234intel graphics on SB will beat blu ray and 1080p video playback on any nvidia or AMD GPUYou can't be serious!</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byKnightWRXSo, the &quot;Nehalem&quot; Mac Pros could be updated while the &quot;Westmere&quot; Mac Pros could stay the same or get a slight speed/spec bump.  Just like what happened last summer with the new 8-core/12-core boxes.Quote:Originally Posted byHellhammerIn theory, yes, but IMO that's unlikely. Mac Pro was updated quite recently in August. The period between last two updates has been a year and couple of months so Q4 2011 would fit in Apple's update pattern too, and it would keep the Mac Pro as &quot;pro&quot; level machine by utilizing the high-end chipset and CPUs, rather than mainstream LGA 1155 parts (though performance may be the same with two similarly specced CPUs).Big thanks for your thoughts Hellhammer &amp; KnightWRX.So it seems there's a chance, however narrow, that apple could introduce a quad sandy bridge early 2011, but the safe money is on them sticking to their snail-pace update cycle, meaning Q4 2011, or even Q1 2012.I felt very let down by apple when they switched to intel, making my PPC G5 virtually redundant. If they pull the rug on me again after investing this time round by releasing the Sandy Bridge just afterwards, without due warning, then me and apple desktops will finally be parting ways. A shame since i've stuck with apple while the majority of my industry have chosen Windows.Anyway, rant over - thanks again. I guess i'll have to chance it and update now, since i can't wait until Q4.</text>

But that's probably what's going to happen, sadly; we will be sequestered to the 15&quot; MacBook Pro for features beyond the bare minimum.</text>

I remember the uprising when Apple got rid of the Floppy Drive...That'd make sense if there was a viable option poised to take its place.  Sure, downloadable software is the future, but it's not the present in the way that CD-ROM based software was for Macs in 1998 when the first iMac started the floppy-killing trend.  Downloading Final Cut Studio, StarCraft II, and iLife is still a pain in the ass with current ISP speeds.As for the next MacBook being aluminum akin to the 13&quot; Pro (which is poised to disappear), then sure, though they already did that song and dance and that got us where we are now.Quote:Originally Posted byRichard1028Why would Apple want to basically sell a cheaper and faster Air with more internal storage capacity?No. The MB White stays in all its plastic splendor.

I hope Apple can get the best of Intel's speed and low power consumption, as well as utilize dedicated graphics from other companies if needed. I would assume there would be a pricing scheme where a computer maker could use Intel chips with other GPUs but simply pay a higher price for Sandy Bridge and later processors. Who knows, but I can see this hitting the courts and causing delays.I would expect delays.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byDCfilmsThanks. Would this be better than a Sandy Bridge Mac Pro (i don't if a Sandy Bridge Mac Pro would also utilize a graphics card, or as suggested elsewhere, makes the graphics card obsolete.Sandy Bridge makes low-end (&lt;50$) cards obsolete but it's still lightyears behind ATI 5870 for example. Besides, Sandy Bridge-E (i.e. LGA 2011 parts, the parts for Mac Pro) don't even have an IGP so a discrete GPU is a must for the computer to operate.Sandy Bridge Mac Pro will likely get newer graphics too. From the current lineup, it would probably be 6870 and 6970 but we might see AMD 7000-series if it is released before new MPs.So no, the current MP won't be better than SB MP but the wait time is long and IMO not worth it. The GPU can always be upgraded later on if you need more graphics performance</text>

Honestly, they JUST updated the Mac Pro line and it looks great, I'd get one.  Figure out how many cores your software will fully utilize, and customize accordingly (they have quad-core, hexa-core, octo-core, and 12-core configuration options), and go for it.  Get the Radeon HD 5870, unless you know for sure that you'll upgrade to the next card Apple has in a Mac Pro, in which case the 5770 will tide you over just fine until then, and you're set.  Unless you'd find your needs served just as well, if not better by a quad-core 27&quot; iMac.  It has become a popular favorite among the video editing community.</text>

The fight is about Intel not letting Nvidia to make chipsets for iX CPUs, thus Nvidia can't make chipset with their IGP for iX CPUs.</text>

You've used two pronouns where the antecedent is ambiguous.If &quot;they&quot; is &quot;Intel&quot; and &quot;it&quot; is a better integrated GPU - they just did!

This is why Apple maintained the use of the Core 2 Duo and went with the GeForce 320M IGP (which also served as a power-efficient chipset, hence the higher rated battery lives on 13&quot; MacBook Pros and white MacBooks of the Mid-2010 generation).  However, with Intel processor based chipsets being a majority of NVIDIA's chipset business and with Intel preventing NVIDIA from developing more, NVIDIA gave up and left the chipset business altogether.Kind of a shame really, they weren't half bad at it.  Oh well, RIP nForce.</text>

And again, they still have a way out of the PR nightmare.  Two of them actually.  (1) If they kill the 2.5&quot; drive bay on the 13&quot; and use the MacBook Air mSATA blade SSDs, the reclaimed room would be enough for a discrete GPU.  Or (2) they could discontinue the 13&quot; MacBook Pro altogether.  PR would have far less clean-up work to do (if any at all) with the white MacBook, MacBook Air (which has some time before it's even due for a refresh anyway), and the Mac mini as most of the customer base for those machines don't really care about continued use of a Core 2 Duo or alternatively, the possibility of returning to Intel graphics that are barely as good as the 320M.</text>

	<text>Steve can talk his way out of the IGP issue. He can simply say that the IGP in Sandy Bridge is so much better which is why Apple chose it. Or just talk about the new ultra-fast CPU and ignore the graphics. I don't think PR will be an issue or matter when it comes to what Apple chooses. Their PR is fine with offering 2006 technology in 2010 so they will be fine with Intel IGP</text>

Apple gives a massive pile of steaming excrement about OpenCL.  I'll agree, they have no problems going backwards a step, but THAT far back, when it's a key technology that they're banking heavily on?</text>

Unless they do away with that particular requirement, which I find pretty unlikely.I'd even suggest a similar idea with the 21.5&quot; iMac - you could conceivably see an IGP-only base model, with the upgraded models offering a discrete GPU.  They could knock a hundred or more off the price, still have high margins and have a very tempting model for the average internet+email consumer.  A quality AIO desktop priced around base MB territory would probably make a lot of people look twice.</text>

It's the trend-setter of how they're going to design their laptops in the same way that integrated battery and Unibody enclosures were before.  In what way?  That's where speculation comes in, and really, I don't think Apple necessarily wants us to be that far ahead.Quote:Originally Posted byErasmusI don't think it makes sense for Apple to have a single notebook with a completely different case to the rest.

That's why you STILL see a white polycarbonate Mac laptop in Apple's line.  Period.  Given that, the white MacBook might get thinner and drop the optical drive, thereby supplanting the MacBook Air, or it might just replace its hard drive bay with the MacBook Air's SSDs allowing for better battery life and instant-on.  Who knows?  Only time will tell.  Either way, I'd say that it's a safe bet that whitey isn't going anywhere.Quote:Originally Posted byErasmusSame thing as before.

Not everyone needs 512MB of VRAM on their GeForce GT 330M, so for those customers a 256MB VRAM option exists.</text>

The blade SSD's can't hold as much data as a standard sized HDD or SSD, so some functionality is lost. You can easily plug in an external optical drive to retain optical disk functionality. Not to mention people usually access the data on their hard drive more often than they use their optical drive.</text>

I didn't know I needed to spell that out for you.http://www.tigerdirect.com/applicati...116&amp;CatId=5300Look harder next time. 256GB for $550. From one of the higher end brands too.And that's last generation. Intel's G3 SSD and Crucial's C400 will be launching soon, offering the same storage for roughly half the price. We're getting mighty close the all important $1/GB mark.http://www.anandtech.com/show/4086/m...s-415mbs-reads</text>

The blade SSD's can't hold as much data as a standard sized HDD or SSD, so some functionality is lost. You can easily plug in an external optical drive to retain optical disk functionality. Not to mention people usually access the data on their hard drive more often than they use their optical drive.The same can be said about an external hard drive.  The only difference is that by nixing the optical drive, you're forcing that function to be external, whereas by nixing the hard drive bay, you're only limiting the size of what's internal.  Also, in the larger non-Air 13&quot; (and definitely 15&quot; and 17&quot;) machines you can probably add a second blade SSD with no problem.  Problem solved.Quote:Originally Posted byKnightWRXWhat makes you say that ?  The Blade SSDs are the same as the standard sized SSDs (what's standard anyhow ?

The fact that the 13&quot; MacBook Air costs what it does given the SSDs sizes inside is kind of remarkable seeing as the 13&quot; Pro with the same size SSD costs more and the Air generally costs more to produce than the 13&quot; MBP.</text>

Apple hates making less money.Apple is going to include the blade SSD one way or the other.  So, if it's nixing anything, the ODD is cheaper than the HDD, therefore losing the HDD in that case is far more cost-effective; it also makes sense.Quote:Originally Posted byAidenShawMost people need 512 MiB or more....  Have you noticed that 1 GiB NVIDIA cards are $35 at Newegg?  There's a reason for that.Yes, it's because they are cheaper to produce.  A vast majority of Mac users couldn't give a damn about how much VRAM they have, hell a vast majority of all computer users don't even know what VRAM is!  You tell a computer illiterate person buying a 15&quot; MacBook Pro that they're buying a graphics card with less VRAM, than the next one up, they'll say either one of two things; (a) &quot;What's that&quot; or, assuming after you've explained to them what VRAM is, (b) &quot;Oh, I don't do much with graphics.&quot;  My point is that whether you give them a weaker GPU or less VRAM, it doesn't matter, Apple already has a weaker video option on the lower-end 15&quot; MacBook Pros and a better one on the higher-end one (as well as the 17&quot; MacBook Pro).Quote:Originally Posted byAidenShawApple customers need to tell the turtlenecked overlord that they'd like a little more &quot;function&quot; in their Apples - even if it means a few mm extra thickness.Like it'd make a difference.  Sadly, there are still far more Apple customers that care about form than function and even if there weren't, Steve-o's ego isn't easily reckoned with.  Being in the minority that want the opposite sucks.Quote:Originally Posted byAidenShawWant a quad MBP - can't because of &quot;thin&quot;.  Want a better GPU - can't because of &quot;thin&quot;.  Want an actual &quot;pro&quot; laptop - can't because of &quot;thin&quot;.That's basically true of every Mac save for the Mac Pro, which is way more money than I want to spend on my personal computer.  Even the iMac is becoming too thin to accommodate as good of a GPU as it should.  The best you can do in that thing is an ATI Radeon HD 5750?!  Come on!  At least a 5770!Quote:Originally Posted byAidenShawApple has diluted the adjective &quot;Pro&quot; to mean little more than &quot;something shiny to show off at Starbucks&quot;.  Meanwhile, other vendors are selling quad core laptops with 1 GiB of VRAM, dual spindles + optical, 16 GiB of RAM capacity for less than most MacBook Pros.Oh sure; Apple is kind of a joke in that regard.  Luckily, programs designed to run on Macs still somehow run well on them; the platform isn't so behind its own technology that software is too advanced to run on it.  Though it does beg the notion that if you have work programs that are native on Windows and Mac, you'll get a much faster workhorse of a computer with that software for the dollar with a PC.Quote:Originally Posted byAidenShawThe MacBook Pros are nice machines, Apple should keep them but add a &quot;MacBook Workstation&quot; line above them - where performance is more important than &quot;thin&quot; and &quot;battery life&quot;.That's essentially what the 17&quot; MacBook Pro is currently, though even those machines are a joke when compared to 17&quot; PC notebooks, that are able to have two hard drives AND a quad-core CPU AND a decent discrete GPU.  The 17&quot; MacBook Pro only has half of that at double the cost.Quote:Originally Posted bylPHONEYou are my hero.What's &quot;pro&quot; about lugging around a USB hub?Trick question!  :-)  Yeah, there really is no excuse for there to only be two USB ports on the 11&quot; to 15&quot; machines and three on the 17&quot;.  THINNOVATION!  Haha, thinnovation my arse!Quote:Originally Posted byMal67+1 :-) Be lucky if they don't get any thinnerIt'd be extremely lucky if they didn't.  They inevitably will.  The MacBook Air being &quot;The Future of MacBooks&quot; has already dictated us our mobile fate, sadly.Quote:Originally Posted bylPHONEI liked things better when motherboards, video cards and sounds cards were all seperate. That way when one broke you could replace it. Now it's all about integration and when something breaks, you throw it away and buy another.Ah, the good old days...though the Mac was never stellar about that.  Luckily the build-it-yourself PC towers still are, and by that token, so is the Hackintosh as well.</text>

It will cut into their margins too much to do that. Not only that, but Apple happily charges $200-$350 to switch out the HDD for the smallest SSD. That would be another large hit to their profit margin.</text>

I'd feel really sorry for anyone who needs over 500GB, which the power user MBP's already come with. A 15&quot; MBP with 512GB of storage would cost around $2400+.

	<text>My thoughts about the new Macbook pro line:I am new here, but I am following this forum for some time now. I did some research using sites like: anandtech; wikipedia and other sites.So my thoughts: I think the line-up will be more or less the same as last year. I expect the same number of laptops as now. I know some sites say there will only be 4, but Apple has choosing these before with a reason and think they will keep it. Also on the forum you read a lot of people buying BTO&rsquo;s and these come with some good margin.So:13 inch and a 13 inch BTO, 3 times a 15 inch and of course the 17 inch.Old	13 Inch	13 inch	15 inch	15 inch	15 inch	17 inchProcessor	P8600	P8800	I5-520M	I5-540M	I7-620M	I7-620MSpeed	2.4 GHz	2.67GHz	2.4Ghz	2.53GHz	2.66Ghz	2.66GHzTDP	25W	25W	35W	35W	35W	35WPrice ($)	241	241	225	257	332	332NewProcessor	I7-2629M	I7-2649M	I5-2520M	I5-2540M	I7-2620M	I7-2620MSpeed	2.1GHz	2.3GHZ	2.5GHz	2.6GHz	2.7GHz	2.7GHzTDP	25W	25W	35W	35W	35W	35WPrice	311	346	225	266	346	346So except the 13 inch the new version of the old chip will be used. Same TDP and prices more or less the same. Quad core uses to much power and therefore will not be used. The speed indication which apple uses is in line. Starting at 2,1 GHz till 2,7 GHz for the fastest with this line up. The i3 chip for the 13 inch (only i3-2310M) uses to much power: TDP 35 W instead of 25 W like it uses now) so this one will not be usedThe 13 inch is a problem, but that was also last year the case. I think the main problem is the price of the chip. It is much more expansive then the old processor at introduction. This is probably because the IGP is included in this chip, but last year it was not good enough the leave the 320M out of the 13 inch. So Apple decided to keep the old chip with the 320M. This year with the better IGP there is the possibility they leave the graphics card out on the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; 13 inch.. The new Nvidia 520M will probably be the new card for the BTO and maybe the normal one.So margin is under pressure (especially for the 13 inch) because of the higher price of the chip, so some possibilities. Higher price point, but think they will try to keep the price stable as much as they can. Use another chip, maybe an old Arrendale chip, but it will be much more favourable to have the same chips so you can also use the same memory and get purchase advantage. So the price needs to come from other parts and therefore the super drive (SD) needs to go. If it will on all formats? I am not sure, but it is a opportunity to sell the laptop for same price and sell an add-on (like screen, SD box like air etc.) separately. This parts generate a lot of margin. Chance to include more battery, save weight and you nearly never you have to use it. I would leave it out.For the other formats, the Nvidia 525M will probably the choice, because it is the updated 4 series, which was the updated 3 series of Nvidia (Which was used 330M). The 5 series uses most of the parts of the 4 series according to Anand and so TDP will probably be the same. No battery loss for Apple which is very important.Casing will keep as it is, but SSD&rsquo;s are used. Some say it is hard to make it work with two parts (SSD and HDD), but this is a computer manufacturing and software developing company so they will make it work. There are some sites who did also make it work (using Unix methods for instance), so I expect no problems. It is the way it will go, like Jobs said.Screens no updates.One more thing and that is also which will decide the introduction date: Light Peak. It is so quiet about the technology from Intel. Normally, like the new SNB chips, the reviews and other stuff is already on the net before they introduce it. So two possibilities: A) it is far from ready B) Apple will use it first. I hope option B.If this is the case then it depends when LP and the SNB dual core chips are available.1: LP and SNB are available next month, then it will be end feb.2: LP not yet ready and apple will introduce it then maybe march/April. But no later because then option 3 will (and needs to be) chosen.3: LP not ready then depends SNB and Nvidia are ready for mass production which is probably end feb.What do you think? Some strong points or not?</text>

Who is to say that neither the $300 cost of the SSD nor the cost of some other component isn't going to go down between last rev and this next one?I'm pretty confident that it will be standard, though I'll grant you that it may not be standard, but it will be optional on every model if it isn't.</text>

So my point stands, the Blade SSDs are not necessarily offered in lesser capacity than standard sized SSDs something you were trying to say.  There's nothing different about the Blade SSDs except the fact they aren't in a 2.5&quot; casing.</text>

That said, there's no reason why you can't have two side by side to make 512GB.There are64GB NAND chips. Eight of them (4 per side) would give you 512GB. Looks like they don't cost you an arm and a leg, more like arms and legs along with your headLike I said above, Crucial's C400 (25nm) brings 512GB to ~800$ which is hundreds less than the cheapest 512GB drives available at the moment. Other manufacturers should have them for even cheaper</text>

Also, in theory, if it was a PCIe card, shouldn't it then be seen in the PCIe-cards section as well?I think that's what I said.As far as a &quot;PCIe card&quot;, it depends.  Many devices, both in the chipset and soldered to the motherboard, are actually using PCIe even though they aren't separate &quot;cards&quot;.  Even the Intel integrated graphics is a PCIe device.  I'm not sure that anything in the PCI space distinguishes a removeable card from from an embedded device - but of course a utility aware of which PCIe lanes are routed to card slots could make that distinction.For example, my Asus netbook reports:Code:Bus 0 (PCI Express), Device Number 2, Device Function 1
 Vendor 8086h Intel Corporation
 Device 27A6hMobile 945GM/GU Express Integrated Graphics ControllerCommand 0006h (Memory Access, BusMaster)
 Status 0090h (Has Capabilities List, Supports Back-To-Back Trans., Fast Timing)...


 Bus 0 (PCI Express), Device Number 31, Device Function 2
 Vendor 8086h Intel Corporation
 Device 27C4h 82801GBM/GHM (ICH7-M Family)Serial ATA Storage ControllerCommand 0005h (I/O Access, BusMaster)
 Status 02B0h (Has Capabilities List, Supports 66MHz, Supports Back-To-Back Trans., Medium Timing)
 Revision 02h, Header Type 00h, Bus Latency Timer 00h
 Self test 00h (Self test not supported)
 PCI Class Storage, type IDE (ATA)
 PCI EIDE Controller Features :
   BusMaster EIDE is supported
   Primary   Channel is at I/O Port 01F0h and IRQ 14
   Secondary Channel is at I/O Port 0170h and IRQ 15
 Subsystem ID 830F1043h Unknown
 Subsystem Vendor 1043h ASUSTeK Computer Inc
 Address 0 is an I/O Port : 00000000h
 Address 1 is an I/O Port : 00000000h
 Address 2 is an I/O Port : 00000000h
 Address 3 is an I/O Port : 00000000h
 Address 4 is an I/O Port : 0000FFA0hWindows Device Manager doesn't distinguish &quot;cards&quot; from integrated PCIe devices - it does point out categories like &quot;storage controllers&quot;.  So, if the mini-PCIe SSD really was a PCIe device with a controller as well as the disk - I'd see an extra storage controller in the list.  (I don't, but I do see disks on the IDE channels of the SATA controller.)</text>

You mean to tell me that it makes more sense to spend all day downloading that one program from the Internet?  Or, more realistically forego my optical drive or force me to wirelessly piggyback to my shared optical drive over the network to install it when doing so from the local optical drive would be much faster?

That said, Apple doesn't think itself a software company, and for the most part it isn't.  Given that fact, no kidding they want us all to focus on OS X.  Were it not for OS X, we wouldn't be shelling out all this money when we could get the same specs on more inexpensive hardware.

It's fast because it's a better operating system.  Period.  It runs more stable than other OSes because there are only so many drivers as there are only so many Apple machines running the OS; as a result there are way fewer driver combinations and with most machines having a majority of the system components on the logic board, that means it is even easier to load the right drivers from the get-go and never have to worry about 'em again.  That's it.  Nothing special.  Nothing iPad-Magical about it.You also go against your own point; of course a 15&quot; or 17&quot; MacBook Pro would be able to best the performance of a 13&quot;.

Stereotype much?The market audience of the 13&quot; MacBook Pro tends to fall into two camps.  Those who buy it primarily for aesthetic appeal, and those who buy it because they have a specific need for a feature not present in the white MacBook, but either can't afford or don't need a 15&quot; MacBook Pro.  For the former camp, that stereotype is pretty accurate.  For the latter, it sucks that (a) we can't have those features on the $999 computer and/or (b) we can't have the $1199 laptop be better than it is, especially for that cost.  The 13&quot; MacBook Pro is really the only of the four that use the Core 2 Duo and the 320M that, for what it is and for the cost, badly needs to be more than that.  Then again, that's only for one of the two aforementioned camps of customers of that machine.  The other camp could care less.This is coming from someone whose favorite currently shipping Mac is the 13&quot; MacBook Pro.</text>

They just need a tough computer to run Autocad so they are able to create. And they keep their Macs until they break.  These guys are Pros. The other one who change their laptops everytime a new Mac comes out are just possers with cash that seek happiness in the wrong place.But at the same time Apple needs some folks to unthoughtfully spend their money on Apple products that they not need because this is how Apple makes profit.Conclusion: There are 2 kinds of Mac users. The ones who think and use their computers the way they should. These are the Pros. And the other ones who spend money on Apple products just because they are shinny. These are the fanboys. Luckily for Apple there are a lot of fanboys out there.This is how it is.</text>

You can find plenty of white or silver laptops, and whether they copy Apple or the other way around, it's the lack of MS Windows which makes Apple great, or not so great depending on how one perceives their experience with the operating system.Otherwise, I agree with about 99% percent of what you are saying.</text>

They are a very viable package on the inside and out, and their advertising isn't so bad, either. Even when they seem to mistake facts or diss Windows/Microsoft in unfair ways, Apple finds a way to do it with flair. Their &quot;Hi, I am a PC and I am a Mac&quot; guys was a brilliant ad campaign.I love the part where the PC guy freezes.In reality, I haven't had any freeze-ups since Windows 95 and Windows 3.1, but probably only because I always had to maintain Windows 98. From Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 on, things have been pretty good and it's not as bad as that dude who plays the PC on the funny Apple commercials.</text>

	<text>FWIW, a fanboi, to my mind, is someone who defends Apple even when they're clearly screwing us over more than usual and Red33m fits that bill a lot more readily than Yebubbleman, who I mostly agree with.Apple's USP is the design.  Whilst they excel at both hardware and software design, its the latter that sells their products, but since the OS comes free with the former, its hardware sales that directly generates their revenue.I, for one, would not pay the Apple tax for the hardware design alone (ie if every computer ran Windows 7, I wouldn't buy a MBP), but would probably keep paying it if Apple's had ASUS-styling.  Nevertheless, (and BACK ON TOPIC!!) I will not be getting my wife a White Macbook until the processor is less than a year old, cos what's under the hood contributes to the performance and longevity of what is undoubtedly an over-priced entry-level product.</text>

You don't need to be a programmer to run Ubuntu, you just need to be able to read forums and follow directions.  It's just as stable as Mac OS X, just sans the apps.Quote:Originally Posted byRed33m4. So after researching all the given choices to Windows I finally decided to move on to Apple and saw that it combines the base of Linux with the ease of Windows. I repeat. I don't own one. I just use one really often. I still can judge them though.Fair play, though I lol at &quot;ease of Windows&quot;.Quote:Originally Posted byRed33m5.And don't BS me that I don't see what the other ones have to offer. Were you gonna change if you could? No. Exactly. I prefer like you a Mac over a Vaio. So I don't waste my time reserching what the others have to offer like I used to because I will end up disappointed by Windows and installing Linux once again. I have better things to do instead.When I can build a Hackintosh with way faster innards for a third of the cost and the end result is that I'm running the same Mac OS X that we all know and love just on a way faster computer, it is absolutely fair to compare Apple's hardware to what could be inside instead.  To blindly assume that they are doing their best is ignorance and stupidity.  I'm sorry.Quote:Originally Posted byRed33m6. Even if Apple and Asus are using the same boards. Someone is doing his job better than the other one. Do you agree? I think you do. But you just disagree with me just because you want a flame war in the end.It is my personal wish that everyone get along, online and offline.  I don't like flaming people.  Nor do I like disagreeing with people, let alone people who don't see all sides of the issue.  Yes, Apple's engineering is rad.  Yes, Apple's software is rad, but I (a) completely disagree that alone shouldn't justify that price for the complete package, no matter how amazing it is, and (b) firmly believe that with better hardware on the market, the $2,000 that I was going to spend on my soon-to-be MacBook Pro should be a better MacBook Pro than it currently is today.  As for your counter-comparison regarding Apple and Asus, if both manufacturers are using boards made by Foxconn, then how can you say that one was better or worse engineered than the other; THEY WERE MADE BY THE SAME COMPANY!Quote:Originally Posted byRed33mI totally agree with you on that. This is why I just look at Macs. Because of the OS. But the other guy just doesn't seem to understand...Or he does it on purpose.You're insane.  I love the OS, but I'm not so shortsighted that I don't focus on hardware running the OS.  Sure, the OS is what's amazing, but it's the hardware that Apple is charging me the arm and a leg for.  I work hard for that arm and that leg, therefore I don't see it as being unreasonable to both follow and gripe about the hardware I'm paying that for.</text>

They might even go down your throat there.Frankly, I don't see anything wrong with Uncle Steve making money if his company has earned it. On the other hand if you're reading Barefeats and are concerned about performance you're more than likely making plenty of money, just love looking at benchmarks to be informed, or both.Quote:Originally Posted byRed33mIn order for an arcitect to succeed all is needed except a decent amount of processing power is IMAGINATION..and that my friend money can't buyHere we go again with the usual heart of an artist trip.I'm not an artist and if Apple could get its UI consistency together instead of having people drool over it (or bemoan the inconsistencies) maybe they'd realize how gray and utilitarian it is. Straight lines with a few curves never got more attention as art. I'm a fan of Baroque and Neoclassicism. Then again I'm just a Liberal Arts major working in IT.The more you know.

A bit lame actually.

We will see what AMD has in store next, but they will have to put out some mobile chips with superior battery times if they are to recapture some of the market.AMD has always had more strength in their desktop line than their mobile line.  Unfortunately, that only applies to the only one Mac model shipping with a desktop processor, the 27&quot; iMac, and while the dual-core model is lacking, the quad-core model is just fine with its i5/i7.  Where they might serve Apple best is on the lower-end with machines that need an IGP that is either integrated into the CPU or the chipset, as AMD's graphics division (formerly ATI) doesn't suck with their IGPs like Intel does with its.Quote:Originally Posted bygigi11192i dont know about you guys, but i just think the snb is gonna be a great update.(esp. for mbp 13).we get thinner, lighter, and longer battery, and great performance boost.Personally, i dont think we need that nice graphics for a 13 inch laptop, if you want to play hard-core games, go buy 15 or 17 or just enjoy with a desktop. dFor the 15&quot; and 17&quot; MacBook Pro, it'll be rad.  For the 13&quot; Pro, if they can't find a way to use discrete graphics, it'll blow, almost to the point where they'll consider discontinuing the 13&quot; Pro altogether (they're already slated to only put out four models, which conveniently excludes the two 13&quot; models from the current six model line-up).  We don't need nice graphics on the lower-end Macs, but giving us less than the performance offered by the 320M on a 13&quot; Pro is just plain wrong.  The white MacBook, on the other hand will get the upgrade and it'll be rad.  Otherwise, I fail to see what's so weird about a 13&quot; laptop with nice graphics, you see 11&quot; and 12&quot; laptops with higher-end NVIDIA graphics all the time.Quote:Originally Posted byMal67Tongue in cheek?Because gray and utiltarian with straight lines is my impression of the macbook pro design.

Given that, I'm not sure what you're referring to.End of July was the last update and that was the overhaul of the internals (next overhaul should be screen size and case).If you look at the buyers guide there is normally a bumpdate 6-7months after the overhauls. Ok so probably only new CPU and GPU options on the same Mobo. Maybe cheaper SSD options, but an update none the less maybe without media event.Look at the MacPro it use to get more regular updates as well. Plus it's in need of an overhaul update not just a bumpdate, which would need a media event plus with the death of the xserve and questions over Final Cut they need to talk to the people about these things.Quote:Originally Posted byCmdrLaForgeMaybe Apple just discontinues the Macbook Pros and the Macbook and from now on everything will just be like the Macbook Air.

Don't expect anything before the beginning of May at the earliest, iMac-wise.  Should it get an update, absolutely, they timed the last refresh poorly as they were only months shy of newer AMD (ATI) Radeon cards, among other common technology advances that would've made it worth the wait.  But will it get an update, no, not realistically.The Mac Pro doesn't need to get updates as frequently as it's plenty fast and plenty expandable.  As it stands, they're only updating it when the Xeon updates, which also doesn't need to be as often as it's not a mainstream consumer product.Apple also doesn't need to talk to the public about the discontinuation of the Xserve; it didn't sell, and it clearly doesn't fit their marketing strategy for servers (or lack thereof).  Nor does it need to pat the Final Cut community (of which I consider myself a part of) on the back and assure them that an update is coming.  They're Apple and they'll do whatever the hell they want to.I swear, some people on these forums really get mixed up between what Apple is likely to do and what they really want Apple to do.</text>

As far as the integrated processor, it's still supposed to be a pretty big increase as the last (current) Intel IGP doesn't even touch the last generation NVIDIA GeForce 9400M IGP, whereas the IGP on Sandy Bridge is slightly less powerful than the NVIDIA GeForce 320M IGP (The generation of NVIDIA IGPs after the 9400m; currently the best IGP you can get on the older Core 2 laptops), which leads me to believe that, like the 320M, it's significantly more powerful than the 9400M.  So while Intel's next IGP (in Sandy Bridge) is not as good as the incumbant NVIDIA IGP (on the lower-end Macs with NVIDIA IGPs), it is still going to be a vast improvement over its predecessor in the current Core i3/i5/i7 processors.  Though, leave it to Intel to leave us underwhelmed in terms of integrated graphics performance.</text>

Though, leave it to Intel to leave us underwhelmed in terms of integrated graphics performance.3dmark vantage 312 vs 2186, thats pretty big to methats like the game not even loading vs being playable at an OK frame rate.</text>

Where I lose enthusiasm is when it's compared to the GeForce 320M used with a Core 2 Duo and it still loses, albeit barely.  Come on, Intel, you're using NVIDIA's intellectual property!  You should be able to do better!</text>

Still, the notion that NVIDIA's IP is going into Sandy Bridge, gives me a little bit more confidence, though, they still have catching up to do.  Maybe with Ivy Bridge, they'll finally be at least a hair faster than the 320M.</text>

Though, leave it to Intel to leave us underwhelmed in terms of integrated graphics performance.Thanks for the info.It sounds like integrated graphics have made a jump (maybe even a big one), but are still a long ways away from the superiority of a dedicated graphics processor.You are in my neck of the woods. I took the prereqs (most of them) for a computer engineering PhD at UCSC and it's amazing how academia doesn't give a person any idea what the end product (or applicable product) is or can be. I may go up to Baskin Engineering up there and ask around about Sandy Bridge but I suspect many won't know what it is, even though processors is what they study in theory. Sometimes, rarely though, you can find an engineering student who both uses computers for gaming and business applications, and can explain engineering theory as it relates to a product release right now, or coming up shortly. It's fairly rare though as many get relegated to a tiny corner of their field if they embark on graduate education.That being said, a processor takes so much information from so many disciplines that it's very hard to find a person who has an eagle's eye view of what goes on.A friend of mine is working on a type of computer language which he estimated a decade ago would take 200 years to develop. Now with inroads made from colleagues he didn't know about, the prospect of a self-replicating code may be seen in the next century, not two centuries from now. He based his models on current technology of the time without even seeing how massive the bump in speed and storage would change the outlook of his field of AI. He was one of the first in AI to actually use a mouse, so being merely human that was a giant thing to wrap one's head around when he started with vacuum tubes and doing the math before the invention of math co-processors. His head is so in the theoretical and academic research that he has no idea nor interest where current technology stands. He can't load a driver from a CD nor does he know, or care, how to use a PDA, cell, or anything electronic. But what he discovers and works on will be just a brick in a step in a long stairway which will get us where his field wants to be. When his group of scientists come up with a concept, the engineers take what is good and toss out what is rubbish, and make something out of it.But many cutting edge corporate engineers (who work a little more in the practical) who sweated blood to get where they are working on a decade or decades long project sometimes fall into the mold that what they are doing is THE most important project in technology and the last of its kind. If I had a penny for every engineer or scientist who said computers would stop going down in price or that processor technology will eventually cease to improve, I would be very rich.My guess is that it's a long time before integrated graphics will satisfy the average gamer. From what reviews I have read, the current (pre-Sandy Bridge) &quot;i&quot; processors can handle a CS Suite for most tasks, but not all of them in satisfactory manner. For video within CS, a dedicated GPU with Core 2 Duo still seems more the thing than an i5 by itself in many forums about this kind of stuff. The same is said for many games from gamers like me who don't do well enough to know the difference. If ever I get good enough to that point, which many youth are at right now, I may see how Sandy Bridge is a big step up in the &quot;i&quot; series chips, but still a far cry from dedicated graphics processors. I don't think Intel bashing is all about going after the big guy.I suspect that there's merit to the still unsatisfied hard core gamers towards integrated graphics.</text>

As you said, the i3 doesn't do turbo, which is something everyone can use.Even the MacBook Air should really be classed as a mid level computer. It still uses pretty good CPUs.It would be nice to start in the middle of the &quot;i&quot; line, but it's never been Apple's thing to be that cutting edge in processors on the Intel side. The PCs usually have the faster processors.That being said, Apple has the better OS, better industrial design, better bundled software, and better service so their products are worth it.If Apple sold a laptop for $800 dollars sporting an i5 like the PC side does, a lot would have to give. But with a Mac, you can expect the Macbook to cost $1200 with Sandy Bridge i5 and the price would be unacceptable as an entry level laptop as Apple won't diminish software, hardware, or support.To keep all the great things about Apple going, and get a laptop for under a grand, it wouldn't be that much of an imposition to have a Sandy Bridge i3 being that the previous processor was a Core 2 Duo. If possible keep the rest of the laptop the same, if not better, but I think it would sell.The Core 2 Duo Macs have done quite well so there's no reason the Core i3 should do any worse. Though dual core, all the &quot;i&quot; series chips act as four logical processors instead of two so it's a step up.</text>

(a) Because the last rumor regarding the upcoming MacBook Pro refresh seemed to indicate only four new models, which conveniently eschews the 13&quot; models, and (b) given the debate on the IGP and given Apple's stance on graphics muscle being more important on that machine, and not to mention increasing similarity internally to the white MacBook and the MacBook Air, Apple could easily justify discontinuing that model in favor of beefing up the white MacBook (or merging the two lines into &quot;The Next MacBook&quot;), in which case, your would-be prediction for the low-end 13&quot; MacBook Pro having the i3-2310M would probably make that same CPU a likely target for the white MacBook in the same vein that the current bottom of the line 13&quot; MacBook Pro and the white MacBook currently share the same CPU.Just my two cents to your two cents.  Apple could still surprise us all.</text>

Definitely a typo on my part, I meant to say &quot;thicker&quot;, but I think it got mixed up in my brain as I'm used to saying &quot;The MacBook Pros are too thin, if they were thicker, then we could have a quad-core, dedicated graphics in the 13&quot; model, etc.&quot;.  Maybe I say it too much.  Realistically, them being too thin seems to be the only reason I can come up with as to why they haven't done it yet; there's gotta be some kind of technical limitation, otherwise, they could make the 17&quot; a quad-core model and, by that token, have it sell more.
