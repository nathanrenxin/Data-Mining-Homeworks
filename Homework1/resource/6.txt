	<text>Apple's new entry-level UK pricingApple today took down its online store in the UK for a few hours, moving to raise prices to account for an increase in the national value-added tax (VAT) going into effect today that is seeing the rate rise from 17.5% to 20%.The price increases have resulted in Apple straying from its usual price point targets, as an entry-level 13" MacBook Pro or 21.5" iMac that previously cost &#163;999 with VAT now goes for &#163;1020, while the entry-level Mac Pro price has moved from &#163;1999 to &#163;2041.Popular iOS devices have also increased in price, with the 16 GB iPhone 4 rising in price from &#163;499 to &#163;510 and the 16 GB Wi-Fi iPad going from &#163;429 to &#163;439.Some observers had hoped that Apple might choose to simply absorb the tax increases by reducing their prices slightly in order to maintain the psychological price points used for many of their products, but the company obviously decided that it needed to pass along the tax increase to consumers in order to maintain its margins.Apple's old entry-level UK pricing</text>

	<text>Sorry for UK consumers, but there was no need for Apple to absorb somebody else's tax increases as lower margins. They are not competing at the edge where 30 pounds is a decision factor.</text>

	<text>Wow, VAT is ridiculous! 20% is crazy.  read studies that VAT didn't help maintain a lower overall cost of taxes as &quot;theorized&quot;, the money was just spent by the politicians anyway.  No wonder so many Europeans come to the USA for shopping trips and smuggle their purchases back in</text>

	<text>Sigh. It would have been nice if they had absorbed it, particularly given their high profit margins compared to other companies, and trying to keep the pricing simple. But oh well - it's not the end of the world, and I certainly would be any less put off by buying stuff for a tiny percentage. Sith happens.</text>

Good, because it reminds the customer how much tax they're paying - and that keeps politicians in check. Bad, because it's annoying to have to keep working out how much you'll have to pay.Quote:Originally Posted byjav6454Last I checked, UK prices (without VAT) are higher than US prices (without Tax) but a noticeable margin.

Effectively we can demand the repair or replacement of a product during it's natural life if it breaks due to a manufacturing defect... and that gives us some of the benefits of extended Applecare 'for free'.</text>

In a sense, they are already making higher margins in the UK than the US and that is an incessant source of whining by our British folk on the forum.The UK prices (based on a spot check) are 5% higher than the US prices when factoring out VAT.  This premium covers GBP/USD currency hedges, be they internal or external contracts.  It may also cover some import duty, but I don't think that is a significant contributor.Currencies are volatile, and companies need to reconcile against the different currencies of their income, expenses, and reporting countries.  Fortunately, they aren't that volatile, and a 5% spread will cover most of what happens in a product cycle so there is no need to regularly adjust prices.</text>

Now I know Apple is not charity nor are they known for affordable products. But couldn't they just have absorbed the cost?This may come back and bite them in the arse.Can't speak for Apple, but I know in software we price in Europe higher because the cost of sales is higher. Plus we have to account for fluctuations in currencies so prices are padded. Now, I'll also say in past companies we also raised prices in some countries because the market will bare it and the channel partners want the higher price so they make more margin. It's a more complex than just taking a 1 for 1 price exchange. Just pointing it out... still doesn't make it fun for the UK and other countries.</text>

	<text>The UK politicians may have hoped companies would absorb the tax increase but it is not their obligation to and they should not!   By Apple raising the prices, it reminds us all about tax increases, fees and other government obligations placed on companies.  Apples job is to develop great products that we want and are willing to pay for to provide a return for their investors.  It is the consumers who will pay the taxes and fees one way or another!</text>

Although that is pretty fair as it's still actuallycheaperin the UK than the US!</text>

	<text>In the U.S., Apple advertises the before-tax prices of its products, just like everyone else.Why not advertise the pre-VAT price of its products in England?Is it illegal to advertise the pre-VAT price in England?After all, the tax on products varies from country to country.The actual price before taxes is what the product's advertised price should be. This way, England can do what it wants with the VAT tax.  But Apple's advertised prices will be the same everywhere in the world.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byjameskattIn the U.S., Apple advertises the before-tax prices of its products, just like everyone else.Because the tax varies from state to state - and if I understand correctly you often don't pay tax on internet purchases.Quote:Why not advertise the pre-VAT price of its products in England?Because all of the UK (not just England) has the same tax, and people like to know what they'll end up paying.Quote:Is it illegal to advertise the pre-VAT price in England?You can only advertise pre-vat price if you're selling to businesses. If you're selling to consumers you must show the with-vat price.Quote:After all, the tax on products varies from country to country.Well, it doesn't vary within the countries that make up the UK.And the rule in Europe is that you pay VAT in the country you're buying from - so it doesn't make sense to advertise pre-VAT prices for cross-border sales. Sales tax is charged on internet sales.Quote:The actual price before taxes is what the product's advertised price should be. This way, England can do what it wants with the VAT tax.  But Apple's advertised prices will be the same everywhere in the world.Actually, most countries advertise with-tax rates. It's the US that's out of line, if anything.</text>

	<text>We had the very same issue happen here in New Zealand recently our GST went up to 15% so did Apple&#8217;s prices.$814NZD for an entry level iPad now.Quote:Originally Posted byswingerofbirchAre retailers required to advertise the price with tax? I don't know of anywhere that happens in the US except vending machines, but maybe that's because we don't have national sales tax.In NZ all retail pricing is inclusive of GST, only exceptions are places that sell &#8220;wholesale&#8221; or B2B. That&#8217;s because GST is an end user tax.</text>

For instance, certain states mandate that retailers collect sales tax for the retail value of , say, an iPhone, instead of on the $200 dollar subsidized price. Other states only charge tax on the $200.</text>

	<text>As a postgraduate student in England, I worked with a professor from the former East Germany.  He had a saying that &quot;The people get the government they deserve.&quot;Many people, tired of Brown et al, were tricked in to voting for Cameron (and Clegg) because they wanted a change.  And change those people are now getting, very little of which is good.  My mother (who predicted this would happen under Cameron and Clegg), for example, has lost 90% of her over 60's benefits and now faces a 2.5% increase in the cost of living.We only have to look at British history to see how this happens time after time.  The public expect unlimited freebies under Labour and do not get them, so they vote conservative and eventually realize it was a mistake. Then the cycle repeats. Look at the general strikes in the early 70's, and then the time of Thatcher.This increase in VAT, and many of the recent reductions in services are just the tip of the iceberg. I'm not saying that Labour would not have made cuts, but I have to believe they would not have been so drastic.How does this affect Apple, and its prices?  Just wait and see!BTW: Yes, you can quote prices without VAT. It is actually very common in the electronics industry, particularly when tax might be deductible.</text>

	<text>Some countries charge way more than that. Check Brazilian prices for example: R$ 3,799.00 (US$ 2,300.00) for the cheapest (1199) macbook pro... It's 60% plus the state taxes that vary but are around 17-18% over the total (including shipment). That's more than 100% taxes in the final product...I'm lucky I don't live there anymore...</text>

It could allow them a larger margin to account for these additional consumer rights. Apple would similarly enjoy that margin where they make the retail sale.Quote:Originally Posted byApple OCNo Firestarter ... they do not show the Tax in the price ... often you will see some fine print that says +HST but it is never in the price.They just brought it out last year ... and even tacked it onto buying a house.13%I think you're misunderstanding. When I say that a UK price is 'with VAT' - that tax is often invisible (ie, VAT is not mentioned or separated out on the invoice). The price still includes the tax though - and it sounds like the same situation happens in Canada.</text>

That is far worse than Apple going in line with UK VAT.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byDaveoc64I don't think people are blaming Apple for the tax increase.We're blaming Apple for charging UK customers £26 ($40 US) more for an Apple TV that does less than it does in the US.Other products have similar discrepancies.As others have noted, other major international retailers are not passing on the VAT increase - Apple with such high margins surely should be able to.Why should Apple pay your tax? That's basically what you're proposing that Apple do. That is what we call bad business. When you have a product that is in demand, with a relatively short shelf life, you don't lower the price.Apple knows that we, Americans, are smart and if they sold Apple TV for $50 in the UK, that we would quickly find a way to get one and just plug it in here.The same way that people in foreign countries have been buying and renting movies from iTunes.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byfirestarterI think you're misunderstanding. When I say that a UK price is 'with VAT' - that tax is often invisible (ie, VAT is not mentioned or separated out on the invoice). The price still includes the tax though - and it sounds like the same situation happens in Canada.What I am saying is ... there are no prices with the HST included ... it is always a separate item added to the invoice ... never is it shown HST is included in price.</text>

We want them to cost roughly the same. It's one thing to round prices up slightly, it's another to charge 1/3 more. Americans wouldn't import an Apple TV from the UK if it cost the same amount. Not that it would, the £26 extra I quote is AFTER VAT!</text>

Of course the Democrats are to stupid to bring that up.The Democrats-Republicans (yes it's one party, don't let them fool you) are spending are tax dollars on entitlements. The biggest one being the defense contractors. Billions of dollars are spent developing weapons which never leave the proof-of-concept phase. If we cut out defense budget in half we would still spend more money than the next top ten countries combined on defense! Even the Pentagon wants to make cuts, but the Democrats-Republicans say &quot;no&quot;.And please don't forget that the biggest social program we have is Social Security, that entitlement that future generations will pay for.A 20% VAT is crazy, but a 5% VAT/National Sales Tax, is that really bad. It's not going to stop Americans from spending and if it did, then maybe the ones  who didn't spend would save!But then again, I don't think it's crazy to leave a 20% tip when I go out to eat either...You speak the truth.

	<text>Apple's pricing model internationally is flawed, greedy and wrong.I am not in the UK but in Australia, for 12 months now our dollar has been extremely strong and this week passing the $US. While the $US continue to struggle fiscally Australia is seeing good consumer spending, good property growth and the ASX 200  (top 200 Australian companies on the market) is getting stronger every day.We now pay the highest prices in the world for Apple products.They are quick to move their prices up but they will never move them down.Steve Jobs is happy to reply to emails of complaints about f*&amp;(ing air print but when it comes to a decent question regarding a review of their international spot rates for Australia no responses.Shame Shame Shame Apple - Time for me to shop online in the US</text>

Obama and the liberal left like to chastise as evil and greedy, the oil companies that &quot;benefit&quot; from higher gas prices.  Since UK gas is higher, and with all that money those oil companies are making, what would that make them in Obama's eyes.Couldn't the government just absorb some duplicate government jobs?  How about a wage decrease for the politicians?  A 10% across the board budget cut of all government departments?  Deal with fraud and abuse of taxpayers money?  Delete the antiquated government programs that have been on the books for 50, no wait, 100 years... You know there is bound to be some!Bite Apple in the arse?...  Doubt it.  All those rioting over university tuition increases didn't prevent the raise from happening.  So are people just going to quit school so they can get a lower paying job and have a lower standard of living just to spite those who raised your rates?Finally, I see the mentality is not just an American one... Sadly!  However, when is it that one will say, &quot;When will the government do with less?&quot;. You say Apple can absorb the increase.  I bet the analysts and politicians were expecting the same.  Why?!  What is the government's budget?  What!!!  You're kidding right!  And they want MORE on top of ALL they are getting now!  What a bunch of greedy bastards those politicians are!</text>

	<text>Apple's prices in the UK are higher without taxes because, rightly or wrongly, the cost of business in the UK for Apple will be higher.Apple is legally required to provide 28 days of paid holidays, statutory sick pay and healthcare (via employers' National Insurance contributions) for all its UK employees (yes, even the foot soldiers who work in the Apple Store.)  I'd wager none of this is provided in the US, so costs are lower.</text>

	<text>&quot;Some observers had hoped that Apple might choose to simply absorb the tax increases by reducing their prices slightly in order to maintain the psychological price points used for many of their products, but the company obviously decided that it needed to pass along the tax increase to consumers in order to maintain its margins.&quot;As I understand VAT, they've had a 2.5% increase, but most of the product prices only went up by 2% to 2.2%, so Apple gets less money for every product, and the consumer pays more, which is normal practice for every business with rising taxes.  But remember, in the end, the customer always pays for all of it.Frankly, I don't understand why businesses in Europe don't list the product price separately from the tax.like old price:iPhone £354 + £75 taxnew price:iPhone £351 + £88 tax</text>

	<text>any other company would have lowered the prices and raised some other prices in order to make a &quot;nice&quot; price that &quot;looks&quot; good like 999 or 1.490 pounds. but hey, this is apple! they don't care about such things, as long as they can make money, money, money! squeeze the customer! who cares if a mac book now costs 1020 pounds or an apple tv 101. YES they would have lost money if they'd have kept it at 99 pounds, but they will now loose money anyway, because there are people who have a barrier when it comes to go over the 999 pounds barrier. they simply start to say: &quot;do I REALLY need to spend so much money, when for example a similar cool sony vaio costs half the price?&quot;apple has their will, but from a marketing view of it, it is very stupid what they do here! and they know it, and will soon lower the prices.</text>

	<text>First of all, you will still buy apple products as a UK customer if you were already going to buy them.  If you can't afford it now, you couldn't afford it before.  If you think otherwise, apple is not looking for customers like you who want to save 20 quid.  This is not a bargain basement PC company.Secondly, complain to your goverment.  Don't let them walk all over you.  20% VAT seems malicious to me.  I am not the typical socialist hating American, in fact, I see a lot of utility to socialism; however, there is a line... and the UK is beginning to cross it.Take a nice little vacation over here to the US and buy your macs.  You can consider it a discount on your vacation.  Take care.</text>

I found it very confusing when I was in th US. it's good to know what you will pay before you get to the till. I have yet to go to a country other than the US that doesn't do thisI think that it's in part due to sales and coupons (which can be % or simple $ discount) - combined with the lack of a national tax and the fact that even within a state or county their can be different tax rates - and some items don't have a tax rate, but just a tax (here in Oregon, we have [as of the new year] a 30 cent a gallon tax - it's a flat tax, not a percent)Quote:Originally Posted byUrsaMajorI don't trust either party. Last I checked, democrats were helping bankers and gave the rich an extended tax break. So much for hope and change. Things only got worse for most people.Democrats tried to get the tax cut for the top tier(s) to expire - most did anyway. They also tried to extend other tax credits that were for lower-income people, but both were held victim to the fact that the basic tax cuts for lower/lower-middle class incomes was held hostage by others (a majority Republicans)</text>

	<text>20% VAT is pretty much the norm for the European Union countries (some are higher, some are a bit lower) - see the attached table (from the BBC website)Personally, I don't have a problem with the increase - the UK (along with the rest of the western world) is in a complete financial mess and it's time we started to face that fact and try and get back on a firm financial footing by reducing the ridiculously high budget deficit. If that means people have to pay 2% more for material goods then so be it</text>

Random!)However-Apple don't owe us anything, they are entitled to raise and lower prices as they wish, if it gets too high much of the competition is still good.It is the fairest way, as VAT is not paid on many essentials such as food.As much as we all love to moan about tax and our public services, they are excellent and some of them are amongst the best in the world.Overall I don't mind paying an extra ~2.1% on some things to help the economy and try to minimise any changes in our quality of life.</text>

There are many stores doing this at the moment and they can often maintain their operating margins by raising the price of other goods (eg. supermarkets). However, some retailers simply do not have the operating luxury to do this; probably not even Apple with their relatively small portfolio of goods.When a company pays for business related goods and services, they can claim the VAT back.</text>

	<text>so apple can not lower the prices, because the vat went up and otherwise they'd loose money.it might be true, that they'd loose money, but the reality is, that their prices were completely expensive from the start! an example:APPLE TV UK Price: 101 pounds, reduce by 20% tax = 84,2 pounds. exchange this to us$ and you'll get 131,2 us$. so how much does the apple tv cost in the us? 99 us$. that means that apple is charging 32,2 us$ MORE than they do in the US!another example: the mac mini (that should &quot;seduce&quot; pc users to switch to the mac): UK Price: 612 pounds, reduce by 20% tax = 510 pounds. exhange this to us$ and you'll get 794,1. so how much does this machine cost in the US? it's 699 us$. that means apple is ripping uk costomers off by charging 95 us$ MORE.the example shows how apple doesn not really want to be fair here, they just want to get rich by dictating a market without competitors. it's sad to see how much less worth a european customer is for apple compared to the us.</text>

	<text>Much as I hate to say it, I think the VAT rise was a good way of raising some cash.I think for the basics (food etc) it'll have be gradually priced in to give the appearance of being 'absorbed' by the retailer.For expensive goods like Apple - while we might all winge, I don't think an extra tenner or so is going to stop anyone who can afford that sort of thing buying an ipad.So, like everyone, I don't like having to pay even more tax just to buy something, with money I've already paid tax on, in order to pay for the fallout of the financial crisis.However, it's a good way, IMO, of taxing those more who can afford it.</text>

	<text>Ah well.  At least our politicians are now showing fiscal responsibility and trying not to destroy the country's future to subsidise today (like some countries I could mention)VAT is mostly charged on luxuries.  Food, books, chlidrens' clothing etc. are VAT exempt.  Energy bills have VAT applied at a lower rate.  This is a tiny increase and we're still lower than a lot of other EU countries.So in summary I couldn't care less what Apple do here.  My Macs and iPhone haven't suddenly stopped working because of this.  I'll just keep then 2.5% longer and end up paying the same amount.Quote:Originally Posted bySteve121178It will matter if the rest of the EU stop spending.  Ireland, Spain, Portugal &amp; Greece are financially screwed and many other countries are on the brink.Not as bad as the doom-and-gloom media like to make out.  Spain is out of danger.  Greece, Portugal and Ireland are tiny economies that can easily be given a leg up by the larger EU states (as we've already done with Ireland).  The crisis in the Euro is pretty much dealt with.But of course good news doesn't sell as many newspapers.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byKnightWRXExcept for the fact that pre-VAT, Apple prices are higher in the UK than the US after currency exchange.  In a sense, they are already making higher margins in the UK than the US and that is an incessant source of whining by our British folk on the forum.Umm, just to try and dispel the stereotype, there are a fair few of us who don't mind because it's not as simple as straightforward dollars-to-pounds conversion then add VAT. There are other tax costs to consider and the cost of doing business in the UK is significantly higher than the US which is reflected in the price of products, somewhere around 5 - 10% higher is roughly right. Where we do tend to get tetchy is when companies take the proverbial as was the case when the new Mac Mini was introduced (I can't remember the exact figure but it was around double the usual increase from what I remember).As for Apple putting the prices up, I really don't know why anyone would expect them (or any other company in the UK) to absorb a VAT rise. Hell they did better than some companies did as a lot of consumer goods actually snuck up quietly before christmas (of course these prices were then discounted for Xmas sales and when they return to 'normal' there won't be any obvious signs that the companies in question have increased them to allow for the VAT rise).

A few pounds a year paying towards the distribution cost taxes on necessities does not equate to the amount you would be charged for surgery or other healthcare costs if UHC did not exist in this country.  Also, by the same measure US citizens are all paying for the healthcare insurance ofother peoplewhen they purchase goods, even if they have no insurance themselves.I would still rather live in the EU and pay higher taxes than migrate to that medieval serfdom based society across the Atlantic.</text>

	<text>On the Apple Store the iPod Touch price for an 8Gb model is £193 while the 32 Gb model goes for £254. But on Amazon UK they are priced £174 and £229 respectively. Even if Amazon is holding back the VAT increase it's still a significant difference.Also, while the entry level 13&quot;Macbook Pro has gone up to £1020 on the Apple Store, you can pick up the same model for £960 elsewhere.All that will happen is people will shop around and get their Apple products cheaper from elsewhere. It's not as if the Apple Store is the only place to buy Apple products.</text>

	<text>I was suprised that Apple didn't take a hit on the profit margins. Why, it would only be for a small amount of time as when they do thier usual product shuffle they could re-align the price anyway.People are fogetting the added impact of changing the price - all shop displays etc need changing. This would not be required.Also they could use it as a way to sell stuff. &quot;We pay the extra VAT - come buy our products&quot;While people say 2.5% will not make the difference I know a few people that will see this pushing the price up just enough they cannot justify the extra over a 'PC'. With the state the country is in these sorts of rises can and will make a difference to sales.</text>

	<text>To be fair to Apple, when VAT went down to 15% for a while a couple of years ago they were one of the few companies that reduced prices by 2.5% rather than keeping the extra for themselves.On the difference between UK and US I always assumed that as Apple very rarely change a products price throughout its lifespan that they build in a large gap to cover themselves on what the exchange rate will do over the course of 9-12 months before the next upgrade. Its not the best system for the UK consumer but it does make sense from a business point of view as long as people keep buying the product.</text>

There are many stores doing this at the moment and they can often maintain their operating margins by raising the price of other goods (eg.supermarkets). However, some retailers simply do not have the operating luxury to do this; probably not even Apple with their relatively small portfolio of goods.When a company pays for business related goods and services, they can claim the VAT back.Exactly. Supermarket can retain the price because the markup on food is way higher than on computers.I know why they can do that, but my argument was focused that Apple doesn't have to. Saying that Apple has to retain the price because are considered to be selling luxory computer makes no sense, as this is applied on many other businesses.</text>

The previous prices were obviously set so the final price looks good. Otherwise we'd have seriously random prices.I imagine most companies will increase prices over the 2.5% rise so to maintain the &quot;look&quot; of the prices (and make extra profit) or keep the prices the same.</text>

Now, I'll also say in past companies we also raised prices in some countries because the market will bare it and the channel partners want the higher price so they make more margin. It's a more complex than just taking a 1 for 1 price exchange. Just pointing it out... still doesn't make it fun for the UK and other countries.Funny how currencies fluctuate both directions but prices are only padded in one direction.</text>

For example from £1020 or whatever it is back to £999.If they did this in say 6 months could boost sales by quite a lot.Supermarkets do this a lot. They slowly and stealthily increase prices by a few cents over months and suddenly introduce a bargain that looks revolutionary, whereas they basically default back to the original price.Apple could do the same upon a refresh of the products. Increase the price now and when a refresh is introduced (which in Apple's case usually means the components and manufacturing on the whole have gotten cheaper and therefore the margin higher) decrease by a few pounds / dollars / euros.I think though that we are overestimating the psychological effect of the price increase. As has been said before there are not many people that will forego a purchase of a $1799 device if its price increases by $20. I know I wouldn't.</text>

I bought a MBP in late 2008 and just sold it for more than 65% of the value. Try this with any  machine by any other manufacturer and you will be around 35-45% at best.My Apple hardware has also consistently been of better quality with less defects and headaches than other hardware I used before.This all makes it worth to me to pay the premium that Apple charges, because I know that in the time it takes for a device by say Lenovo, Sony or whatever to reach zero value, I know that my Apple device will still be worth selling for a good price and I can use that to finance my next gadget.</text>

	<text>Yeah VAT at 20% sucks, but lets not forget we already paid 17.5% for  long time, it's only an increase of 2.5%...An extra £2.00 on an Apple TV2 really isn't going to uspet me, the vast majority here in the UK buy their iPhones via contract at subsidised prices, so Apples outright prices for iPhone are not a major concern.What really is going to upset me are the new fuel prices today... I've seen £1.29 per litre today. Not good at around 75% tax - I really don't know how they expect us to keep going when our wages aren't rising accordingly.</text>

If we were a truely capitalist society, we would have just let them go to the wall as all other failing companies should and do. But because they had become such an intrinsic part of economies we had to bail them out. And were going to paying for it for a long time to come...But all of that was one mans fault so we can just blame him and not blame ourselves for failing to hold to account those institutions by allowing ourselves to continuously to vote in weak willed politicians held in thrall by the power of multi-national corporations and lacking the backbone and courage of conviction to say NO to them when they should.When it comes to shirking responsibility perhaps it might be a good idea for everyone to look in a mirror and ask it was really a good idea to buy a lot of stuff we couldn't afford, using credit that wasn't ours. I'm guilty of that in the past (not now, got rid of my credit cards years ago, I only buy what I can pay for), I'm sure you've been guilty of it and I'm sure most of us have been in the past. When you look at yourself, ask that and answer truthfully, then you know what responsibility is.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byApple OCIn Canada ... prices are shown without the 13% HST ... because virtually everything you buy has 13% added to it ... the Harmonized Sales Tax is just a given.HST ... &quot;Harmonized&quot; sales tax... That's a laughable term.Back when it was first introduced about a decade and a half ago, it made real sense -- every province which signed on to the program would have the exact same sales tax ... making it easier for businesses to coordinate their pricing across the country, making it easier for consumers to predict the price of any inter-provincial mail-order sales, etc.But then, very few provinces signed on, which only served to complicate inter-provincial mail orders -- GST+PST when selling in-province, GST-only when selling out-of-province to most customers, HST when selling to a select few out-of-province customers...Then some provinces started exempting certain classes of products from the provincial portion of the tax...All of this effectively killed the &quot;Harmonization&quot; of the sales tax.Later, when ON and BC joined the HST bandwagon, NS took the opportunity to use a loophole in its agreement with Ottawa, to raise the provincial component of its HST, so the &quot;Harmonized&quot; tax in NS doesn't even use the same percentage as the &quot;Harmonized&quot; tax in all the other provinces which use it.It's a mess.By the way, back in the day, there was no federal value-added tax in Canada.  Most provinces had a value-added tax, but the federal government took its cut by taxing companies directly for the value of all their output of manufactured goods.  The companies complained that this was needlessly hurting their international competitiveness by inflating the prices of any products they exported.  So the federal government reacted by scrapping the manufacturers' tax, and introducing a federal VAT, which they called the GST.Originally the proposed regulation would have been that the GST would be included in all advertised consumer prices -- which was expected to result in roughly maintaining the status quo, because manufacturers used to have to set their recommended retail prices based upon their own need to recover the cost of the manufacurers' tax.  (Except for the &quot;services&quot; industry, which had never been subject to a federal sales tax before the GST.)But that was scrapped in favour of making it up to the individual retailer to decide whether to advertise their prices pre- or post-GST.  The vast majority decided to advertise the pre-GST price, and it has remained that way.</text>

We understand that. If you want something you have to pay the price. We understand that.The issue people have is that the USAPre-Tax price (displayed on the Apple Website) and the UKPre-Tax price (found on your receipt or calculated from the website with a simple bit of maths) is different. The Apple TV for example costs £84.17 (+ £16.83 Tax at the new 20% rate) in the UK. At thecurrentrate of 1 GBP = 1.56028 USD that £84.17 is $131.33. However the Apple TV costs $99 (+ $varying Tax) in the USA. This difference of $32.33Pre-Tax is what annoys people, and is why some people wrongly thought that Apple might have absorbed the VAT increase in the UK into their profit margin. If Apple had, as some people hoped, reduced the UK Pre-Tax price to £82.50 (and thus kept the Inc-Tax price to £99 with the new 20% rate) the UK consumer would have thought how warm and cuddly Apple was at absorbing the VAT rise into their profit margin and overlooked the fact that thePre-Tax price was $29.72 higher than in the USA.However as others have pointed out previously Apple's cost of trading in the UK is probably higher than the USA due to both the customers statutory rights and the employees rights....</text>

Effectively we can demand the repair or replacement of a product during it's natural life if it breaks due to a manufacturing defect... and that gives us some of the benefits of extended Applecare 'for free'.Then obviously they aren't over charging are they.   It appears that the cost of the legislated warranty requirements are built into Apples price.

Amazon.com. That's UK consumers, like me, buying goods direct from US suppliers and having them shipped over here, because it still works out cheaper than buying here.The VAT rise gets me angry, not at the government, they're only trying to recoup the £2.4bn lost when the previous government reduced VAT to 15%, it made no difference to boosting the economy, the only effect was billions less for the lazy sods in the public sector - or rather an extra few billion on the deficit.The real culprits with the VAT increase are the retailers who up their prices by 2.5% (and maybe a little more). Of course, a rate rise from 17.5% to 20% should see prices increase by no more than 2.1%. It looks like Apple is right on this figure.</text>

	<text>Man that is painful....  the taxes I mean.It is amazing how many things just get passed down to the consumer.  The worst thing yet is, the UK residents are going to feel the pinch from all sectors of people trying to pass down their extra costs to the end user.Consumption taxes suck.  I know because I live in Canada, one of the most tax-ridden countries in the world!...but it's a great country!</text>

	<text>anybody remember the uproar when Apple increasing prices when germany raised their VAT by 1% ?   oh wait...they didn'tin reality though it's always entertaining how apple takes  advantage of currency exchange in their favour for years ... and the few european customers just swallow it up (guess why apple sales have never been as great in the EU as in the US)a few years ago i followed the austrian/germany prices compared to US prices over 2 years and on average the prices were around 19,5% higher pre-tax (lowest: 7,5%   highest: 37%) when the euro-dollars was around 1.30-1.40and that was before the euro hit 1.60 to the dollar.. i suspect during that phase apple was quite happy with the extra money for doing nothing.. because i can guarentee if the euro goes below 1 against the dollar: apple price increase the next daywell i don't care about the apple mac business any more unless i can't think of any other place to put my money ... my mother just bought a high resolution 17&quot; hp notebook with an i5, blu ray etc. for way less than an white macbook with it's horribly outdated hardwareas predicted by many apple is transforming into media and gadget company</text>

Retail is just a portion of the VAT.The businesses that produce and ship the items are normally VAT registered, meaning they can claim back the VAT paid on everything required to make or deliver the product itself.  It's the end purchaser, the consumer, who foots the bill.  For everyone else in the chain VAT is just another cashflow account.</text>

In a sense, a large portion of the VAT is hidden. Retail is just a portion of the VAT.If VAT works anyway like the Canadian GST+PSTs, Retail is the only portion that matters.  Here at least it works like this :- Manufacturer buys goods + GST+PST to make a product.  They get their GST+PST refunded on those goods.- Distributor buys said product + GST+PST from manufacturer.  They get tehir GST+PST refunded on that product.- Retailer buys said product + GST+PST from distributor.  They get their GST+PST refunded on that product.- Consumer buys said product + GST+PST.Who paid the most taxes ?  The consumer who bought at retail.  We are in fact about the only ones paying these damn sales taxes.  Companies get every bit of tax they get charged refunded as long as it was &quot;business expenses&quot;.</text>

I get all that for &quot;free&quot; if/when the time comes, without it bankrupting me and my family and without an insurance company telling me that they don't want to cover more treatment.

	<text>Prices for most things are advertised with VAT in the UK since virtually everyone has to pay it and those who don't (businesses) are generally not going to complain when their purchases come in lower than expected.Its not illegal to advertise without VAT (Computers are traditionally an area where this happens a lot), its just that it really pisses people off when they think they are paying so much and then the price gets hiked another 20% at the checkout. Its their fault, but that doesn't matter to most consumers. They are still gonna get pissed off.Its fine to argue that Apple shouldn't have to absorb the costs of other countries tax increases, or rather it would be if they didn't already factor in massive price buffers against changes in the exchange rates. Its stupid for anyone who keeps track of Apple to expect them to absorb costs when they have an apparent excuse not to.Take the Apple TV. $99 in the US right now which equates to £63.31 at current exchange rate. Add the new 20% VAT and you get to £75.97. It retailed yesterday at £99 Which means Apple have added a whopping 33% &quot;buffer profit&quot; on top in case the dollar suddenly tanks against sterling. And they still saw fit to bump the price of this product by the extra £2 for the VAT increase. THIS is why savvy UK consumers get pissed off with Apple. We expect to pay higher prices than we would for PCs, just like you do in the states. Its fine. But to add an extra third just in case the exchange rates change? Whats wrong with just waiting for them to change and adjusting the prices IF they do? How about you review the prices every month or two? I personally would prefer that to having to pay an extra 10-30% premium on top of our already ridiculous, overtaxed prices.Lets also bear in mind that most Apple products are making margins in the region of 50% to begin with, making their exchange rate buffer even less forgivable.The exchange buffer drops as you spend more, but its still over 10% on a MacBook, and around 7% on a stock Mac Pro.</text>

Alternatively, just multiple the old VAT inclusive price by 1.021: The 2.5% VAT increase equates to 2.1% on the old priceAt the old price of £25, the VAT exclusive price was £21.28 (rounded to the nearest penny).If you add the new VAT rate of 20% to the VAT exclusive price you get a total of £25.54, so they're actually making an extra 46p, not 38pThis is the biggest issue I have with the VAT rise - there will be plenty of companies doing exactly this and shoving a bit extra on their prices and blaming it on &quot;The VAT increase&quot; so the government gets the bad publicity...</text>

The sector of the market they target aren't really feeling the effects of the downturn at all.  Low interest rates on mortgages mean that a large section of people are actually much better off month to month than they were two to three years ago.  Even when the public sector cuts really kick in at the beginning of April it's still not going to hit the Mac/iPhone purchasers that much.Just another example of Western society becoming increasingly divided really.</text>

If the deficit gets under control as planned the Tories will do their usual and lower income tax (or raise the thresholds).  That's how the parties work.  Labour put the tax burden onto earnings, the Tories put it onto spending.  The Tories see the VAT rise as permanent.  They've made no secret of that.</text>

	<text>Why would people expect Apple to hold the price the same.  Apple doesn't lower the purchase price for its products in the US based on what the local sales tax is.  What many of our untraveled US citizens don't realize, is that the VAT has to be added on to the purchase price up-front, unlike in the US.  If we did the same in the states, our prices would &quot;go up&quot; too.People should be pissed with their government for adding more tax to their consumer goods, and thus making the total price go up.  Apple has not raised their price, and should not lower it (which means Apple would have to pay the government the people's tax).</text>

In a sense, a large portion of the VAT is hidden. Retail is just a portion of the VAT.You are incorrect.  Although business pay VAT they also claim it back, so in effect they do not pay VAT at every stage of production and shipping that adds value to a product.Only individuals actually pays the VAT on a product.All businesses claim back the VAT they have paid for goods and services.</text>

Not that it would, the £26 extra I quote is AFTER VAT!Maybe Apple is keeping it the same - relative to Apple's target profit.  The items in the UK/Europe may cost more because maybe (I'm just guessing, I don't know the details) the cost of doing business in Europe is more - minimum employee pay, minimum employee benefits, &quot;employment/unemployment tax,&quot; other taxes charged to Apple, etc are all factored in the cost of an item.  The cost of an item is not simply &quot;how much did we (the company/retailer) pay for it then add x% for our take.&quot;</text>

	<text>This thread is disheartening because there are shades of xenophobia on both sides. I mean who is voting positive? Perhaps the 'positive' button should have been replaced with 'schadenfreude' for this thread?All I'd say to those outside the UK, in the US especially, is (to repeat a point which has really already been made) that I think the disappointment at Apple raising the prices in line with the VAT rise is not because we think Apple should absorb the tax out of some misguided sense of entitlement, or even because the products have high margins and arguably high prices to begin with, but rather because there was already a disparity between US pre-tax prices and UK pre-tax prices. This disparity has been attributed to vague things such as 'the cost of doing business' and suchlike, and to having a bit of leeway for fluctuations in the exchange rates, much of which I personally think sounds like a bit of a fudge that whilst maybe having some basis in reality doesn't explain the situation fully.So I don't think it's that we think Apple should be paying our taxes for us - just that the tax rise exacerbates an existing perception of overall overpricing. Apart from anything else, I don't think it's good for Apple to have a load of silly-looking prices in their store, it's very inelegant and un-Apple like. Even if they rounded some of the figures up and down it would look better... Again, the AppleTV at £101... it's just daft.I'd not be laughing at American Apple customers if they got hit by some increased sales taxes, I think it's sad that some here seem to think we're a bunch of proto-commies who deserve what we get. It isn't the 1780s anymore, we're supposed to friends now!</text>

Where exactly do you think the government gets its money from?No, I think you misunderstand me because I was not personally disappointed. I was referring to people who originally voted Labour with the belief that they would get what I refer to as &quot;freebies.&quot;  When those people did not get what they expected, they switched to Conservative/LibDem and are now faced with a 2.5% increase in VAT (on top of the 2.5% increase from the 15% it was reduced to around 2008).

It is a bit like getting the flu shot or taking cold meds.  Did you not get the flu because of the shot, or because you were not exposed. Similarly, did you not get a computer virus because of your computer/antivirus or because you just avoided virus inducing behavior?</text>

Also you can compare UK/US prices for all sorts of things till you're blue in the face and the scenario has been the same for decades. eg.

	<text>How much simpler the world would be with one bracketed tax...How much is also taxed on income?  20% feels high, but in the states most of our tax comes from income tax.  It is probably higher overall in europe, but there are a lot of hidden taxes besides VAT and sales tax.Here in Chicago sales tax is 12.5% (high for the states), but if I add federal and state income tax to that it would be close to 40% tax (in my tax bracket, top 25% of population).  So a $999 MacBook Air would be $1398.60.Thats before taking things like health care (that we don't get for free) in to account.</text>

It's easy to get confused at the motivations as this isn't a poll with specific questions.Here, you think that when people rate this article positive, they mean it's GREAT that Apple's prices are even higher now that the VAT is higher. Perhaps they are simply rating that it's positive that Apple properly raised their prices at the right time so that they didn't lose money by having to pay part of the VAT price (perhaps they're shareholders). You don't really know the motivation.Yes. There are jerks who who have a chip on their shoulder all the time and they're going to be negative no matter what. Guess what? England has those types, too. They're everywhere. Here on the internet, we call them trolls no matter what country they're from.There are few articles that it would easy to tell what the Positive/Negative numbers meant.

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byptysellI agree that the income tax should be eliminated and either a 'fair' tax or national sales tax should be instituted.  Sadly the current Democratic regime wants an income tax and a VAT tax.I'm a liberal Democrat and I most certainly do not support a VAT tax.  VAT is a regressive tax.  Furthermore, the U.S. States and cities would still need to charge their local sales taxes, so we're going to start paying something like 29% tax on everything we buy in addition to income taxes?  Never happen.   If anyone tried to implement this, the Tea Party demonstrations would be like a...well.. a tea party in comparison to the resulting revolt.   Even if income taxes were eliminated in favor of the VAT, the psychological impact of paying such a big tax on each purchase would be too difficult for Americans to overcome, even if it did actually work out to lower annual taxes for each.Every modern President has said they would try to simplify the tax system, but that's never going to happen because it's a thankless job.   Every group would still want to maintain &quot;their&quot; deduction, whether it's the dependent deduction, mortgage interest deductions, business expenses, etc. and even though the deductions are all a game to rig the system for those in the know and in the end, the government needs the same money to operate.   So even if the system were simplified to the point where everyone paid a (presumably lower) percentage of gross income and there were no deductions, on average, everyone would still pay pretty much the same thing (you'd save some money by being able to downsize the IRS and you'd no longer have to pay a tax accountant, but that's about it).  And the accountants'  lobby would certainly object.   What's the point of expending all that political capital on that?  In the end, no one would be happy.It's the rich who want a VAT tax because they spend less of their income on consumption.    They also want to eliminate taxes on capital gains because they &quot;think&quot; that only workers should pay taxes.    A VAT tax, if applied to everything, including food, rent, and medical is unfair because lower-income people need to spend a much higher percentage of their income (usually above 90%) on essentials.And you can't look at how much something costs across countries simply by doing the currency conversion.   You have to look at it from the perspective of how many hours the average worker has to put in to afford the product.   Furthermore, things cost more in Europe and in the UK because it's more expensive to do business there.   Taxes are generally higher, there's more regulation and restrictions, and while management/executive salaries are somewhat lower than the U.S., benefits cost far more.   Energy costs are far higher.   Europeans laugh at the meager 10 holidays a year that most Americans who work for corporations receive.   And some countries, like Germany, actually have restrictions on discounting.    In addition to more holidays, my co-workers in Germany generally start with six weeks vacation (and they take it).  All this factors into the price of products.I participate in a forum about Nikon cameras and the complaints are exactly the same - how Nikon products cost more in Europe and the UK as compared with the U.S.</text>

So that is quite a swing for some people.I don't really agree with your analysis. The reason we have the deficit we do is because there were way too many 'freebies' given out. That might be difficult for you to appreciate if you're not resident.Quote:I'm not sure how you calculated the &lt;1%, so I cannot really refute it and you may be correct since the British Times newspaper is estimating most people will see about a £400-600 yearly increase if they maintained their level of spending.Well, the increase is around 2.12% on VAT-rated items.Food, fuel (house), mortgage or rent payments, newspapers and books either aren't taxed with VAT, or the VAT isn't increasing. So it depends how much of your mother's income is spent on these necessities compared to durables/clothing/luxuries. Assuming half/half she'd see around a 1% rise.Let's calculate what the £400 increase the Times states actually means. That £400 is the total of the 2.12% increments - so to reach that level you'd have to be spending just under £19k per year on non-essentials.So the Times's £400 example is for someone clearly on well-over average pay. For a poor family it would be a lot less.</text>

Perhaps the 'positive' button should have been replaced with 'schadenfreude' for this thread?All I'd say to those outside the UK, in the US especially, is (to repeat a point which has really already been made) that I think the disappointment at Apple raising the prices in line with the VAT rise is not because we think Apple should absorb the tax out of some misguided sense of entitlement, or even because the products have high margins and arguably high prices to begin with, but rather because there was already a disparity between US pre-tax prices and UK pre-tax prices. This disparity has been attributed to vague things such as 'the cost of doing business' and suchlike, and to having a bit of leeway for fluctuations in the exchange rates, much of which I personally think sounds like a bit of a fudge that whilst maybe having some basis in reality doesn't explain the situation fully.So I don't think it's that we think Apple should be paying our taxes for us - just that the tax rise exacerbates an existing perception of overall overpricing. Apart from anything else, I don't think it's good for Apple to have a load of silly-looking prices in their store, it's very inelegant and un-Apple like. Even if they rounded some of the figures up and down it would look better... Again, the AppleTV at £101... it's just daft.I'd not be laughing at American Apple customers if they got hit by some increased sales taxes, I think it's sad that some here seem to think we're a bunch of proto-commies who deserve what we get. It isn't the 1780s anymore, we're supposed to friends now!Out of all that I didn't see you once putting the blame where it belongs. It looks like politicians have a winner in VAT.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byzinI have to agree with the previous poster; I don&rsquo;t remember Apple dropping their sale prices when the VAT rate was dropped to 15%. I could be wrong, but I really don&rsquo;t remember this.The reason you don't remember this happening is because it did not coincide with the lowering of the VAT. Apple waited several weeks (possibly months) before they lowered their prices accordingly. And yes, again they were making the extra 40p here or there by rounding up or down.Funny how they act so quick to put the prices up though huh?The other thing they did was put their prices up the second the world announced it was going into global recession. Other vendors of various products have adjusted their prices to encourage spending and while Apple have obviously not discouraged it with this policy, one cannot help but feel its about time they did us Brits a favour. We don't expect to get products before the US, but its not very fair to sting us with such a price hike. While our customs charges are ludicrous, I doubt they would account for £50-100 a unit and as mentioned, Apples publicly stated reason regarding exchange rates is just a load of BS.</text>

	<text>Wow Eric, what a deceptive and hit fodder headline. I thought he was better than that.Apple didn't raise anything. The higher cost is 100% due to the higher VAT. In the UK, since the taxes are the same everywhere (unlike in the US), prices include the VAT. So when you pay 1000 pounds, that is what you pay, not 1000 pounds plus taxes which might really be 1200 pounds. Apple is just following that form</text>

What I was trying to get at is that you don&rsquo;t have to pay anything up front; the NHS won&rsquo;t try and rob you of thousands of £££s for an operation or some other treatment (since you&rsquo;ve already paid your share for the healthcare system in the form of taxation).Another example; when council employees come around and collect recycling material or rubbish, they don&rsquo;t ask for money specifically for that pick-up, since you&rsquo;ve already paid your fair share in both taxes (which are sent to local government budgets) and local taxes (e.g. if you pay tax for local county councils). Yeah, it&rsquo;s not free (far from it), but the amount you end up paying for those respective services, in the form of taxation, contributes to a share of the cost, and not the cost in full.I probably should have been clearer in that context.</text>

Rethink, my man, rethink.Well no, you misunderstand me. I think it's sad that people from anywhere feel motivated to find this story positive. I take your point that the positive/negative votes are difficult to assess in terms of motivation.I did say I thought there was fault on both sides, I wasn't accusing Americans specifically of voting positive in a vindictive manner, only the latter part of my post was aimed at specific comments from some US-based posters who seem to have a chip on their shoulder.But yes, you are right that it's quite possible the people voting positive are all doing so with great motivations and none of them are the people making xenophobic remarks. I think it unlikely there is no overlap though.Quote:Originally Posted byNone SuchOut of all that I didn't see you once putting the blame where it belongs. It looks like politicians have a winner in VAT.No, I wasn't trying to blame anyone, just state the opinion that I don't think Apple putting their prices up is a very good thing for anyone.I think it's disingenuous to exclusively blame the politicians though. Of course the VAT rise is a decision they took, but is not something that has happened in a vacuum, and the politicians weren't the only ones responsible for the economic mess that has made the VAT rise deemed something that had to happen.

Complain to your giant governments that take your money.But there is the argument that there are optimal price points for both maximising sales and profits, even at the expense of a small amount of the margin. For example. I'm not sure that putting the AppleTV up to £101 is going to make them the same money, in fact the sales might fall slightly when competing devices are around and less than £100.I don't think anyone is really saying Apple has some kind of 'duty' (if you'll excuse the tax-related pun) to absorb the cost, rather that it could actually make better business sense to do it as an act of good faith for the consumer.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bycallmeYou are incorrect.  Although business pay VAT they also claim it back, so in effect they do not pay VAT at every stage of production and shipping that adds value to a product.Only individuals actually pays the VAT on a product.All businesses claim back the VAT they have paid for goods and services.I recently had to register my business for VAT.Input VAT = VAT paid by the business for products/services.Output VAT = VAT charged to customer for products/services.Output VAT minus Input VAT is paid to the Government.For example, if my business buys hard drives at £40incVAT(input), and sells that hard drive on for £40incVAT(output), Output minus Input =£0. In other words, i am due the Government nothing.However, markup is normally added to products/services that are sold on. If i sold that same hard drive for £60incVAT(output), the Output minus Input leaves me with a surplus, which i then have to hand over to the Government every 3 months.The greater the markup, the greater the VAT(output), the greater i am due the Government.So, businesses DO pay VAT. Sometimes, the Output minus Input calculation returns a negative number. In this situation, the Government pay you back :-)</text>

	<text>To be fair, Apple did lower their prices when the 15% VAT rate was in affect, and have seen to the recent rise appropriately, and increased their prices to match the current 20% VAT rate.DSGi Group and other large retailers in the UK are increasing their prices to move in line with the VAT rate.Lots of people have absorbed the increase, I know of a few local Councils who for example have had to increase their parking permit prices as a result, whilst others have chosen to absorb the increase.</text>

	<text>Not sure if it's been mentioned, but the bellyaching about higher costs in the UK is getting pretty bad.Here's a quick breakdown using the aTV as an example.aTV costs 101 pound sterling.  Factoring out the 20% VAT gets you 84.16UK.  Converting that to US dollars gets you $131.17So factoring out any point of purchase taxes, the price in the UK is about 32% higher.But now look at wages in the UK vs. the US.  I did a quick google and found that the minimum wage in the UK is about 23% higher that in the US.  Making the assumption that UK employees cost Apple 23% more than US employees, then we can say that Apple is charging a 10% premium.I don't have all of the info to see what else Apple has to pay on an employees behalf .. in the US, the employer pays 6.2% of the employee's wage for Social Security.  Not sure what they do in the UK.You also have to add in the UK's import duties on goods vs. the US.  Maybe there are other taxes on devices with flash memory or the such.In the end, it's easy to say that Apple is gouging UK (and Euros), but you have to look at the whole picture.</text>

	<text>I know, it's &quot;only&quot; £20 or it's &quot;only&quot; £10, but for a company worth so much money now,surelythey could cover the relatively small increases themselves. I'd have though them [Apple] taking a little less profit for the sake of being able to say &quot;Mac Pros from less than £2000&quot; or &quot;Apple TV from less than £100&quot;, which can attract customers, is worth not passing the rising VAT to the customers.The price of Apple products is already disgusting over here when you compare them to the USA. Now, I know they're an American buisness, and they have to export them (China's closer to UK than USA though...) but I really can't see why they need to charge us that much more. I've had plans for about 2 years now to buy a MBP to replace my aging white MacBook, but everytime Ireallyconsider it, I stop because it sickens me that I end up paying something like £300 more than someone across the pond would.And don't get me started on petrol prices...</text>

UK Government had classed Jaffa Cakes as biscuits. In the UK, biscuits have VAT and cakes do not.McVities were not happy and took the case to court. McVities won the argument by simply pointing out that, when stale, cakes go hard and biscuits go soft.Go to any supermarket and you will normally find Jaffa Cakes next to........ you guessed it.... other biscuits.Then there is the utterly ridiculous hot-food scenario.If a petrol station sells you a cold pie there is no VAT. If the petrol station heats it up for you BEFORE selling it to you..... VAT applies.If they sell it to you cold, and provide heating equipment (microwave) for YOU to heat it up.... no VAT!!!!Ridiculous!!!</text>

McVities won the argument by simply pointing out that, when stale, cakes go hard and biscuits go soft.Nearly right &ndash; McVities classed them as cakes and hadn't been paying VAT, so HMRC summoned them to court to get the money they said they were owed as the delicious snacks were clearly biscuits. Had Mcvities lost the case, the bill they would have faced in unpaid tax would be huge.This is because that under UK law biscuits and cake aren't VAT-rated &ndash; but chocolate covered biscuitsare, as they're then classed as a 'luxury' product.McVities had to do a bit more than point out the stale/soft angle &ndash; for example, the ingredients and manufacturing process were looked at by the court. But they did indeed win the case, and to this day Jaffa Cakes are VAT free. Which is a good job for MacRumors &ndash; ifarnwas charged VAT every time I posted here his tax bill would be huge.With the hot/cold food thing you mention, the distinction here is that &ndash; by heating the food for you &ndash; the shop is essentially providing you with a service. If you heat it up yourself though, they've not provided said service. I've just checked that with Mrs Cake, a tax inspector.</text>

Which health programs do you no longer want to fund (and see people die by denying expensive medicines)?It's easy to blame the politicians, but they're caught between public saying 'spend more' and those same people calling on them to 'take less'. The only way for them to 'succeed' is to keep borrowing.This UK tax rise is from a UK government trying to spend less, tax a little more and borrow a lot less. It's actually responsible behaviour for a change and I support it.</text>

Well take another look folks at what that Free deal really costs, whether its health care or the thousands of other entitlements the liberals pass out with our tax money just to buy off your vote and to top it off, they do it with your money!Quote:Originally Posted byDaBrainThat sounds like a plaque I saw on a bathroom wall which stated, &quot; If ya can't dazzle them with brilliance, then baffle them with BS! &quot;Call it what you will will, but it still adds an additional 20%.I don't think you've grasped the progressive nature of the British tax system, thus how both VAT and income tax can exist together.Income taxis on a sliding scale. This means those who earn the least pay no income tax whatsoever, the next band pay 20%, the wealthy pay 40% and the super-rich (earning over £150k p.a.) pay 50%. It's important to note that each of the rates are only applied for income in the respective band. As a very simple example, if someone earns £10k in financial year 11-12, they will not pay any income tax on the first £7475 and taxed at 20% on the remaining £2525. This method applies to all the bands in the same way, so the super-rich only pay the 50% rate on their earnings above £150k, 40% on earnings between £35k &amp; £150k, etc.VATis applied at a flat rate for most end-user sales ... so how is it progressive? The rich buy more expensive stuff and more of it; an Apple computer (or a few of them) over a Dell, an iPhone over a Nokia 5110, etc. Those on middle- to-low incomes are more frugal by necessity so end up paying less VAT than those on high-incomes. In addition to this, there's a wide array of goods that have a lower rate of VAT at 5% (domestic heating fuel &amp; electricity) and some are completely exempt (food, children's clothes, products to assist people with a disability).I'm not under any illusion that it's a perfect tax system, such a thing cannot exist, but i do support the notion that those with the broadest shoulders should bare the greatest burden. The end result of such progressive taxation is the ability of the state to provide programmes like the NHS, which for all its failings (accumulating too many middle-managers and the use of insane PFI contracts (thank you labour)) is free at the point of use for everyone, rich or poor, and provides an genuinely excellent service when you need it most. While the NHS gets its share of bad-press and it can be improved but I can guarantee that the people in the UK would never want to see the back of it.</text>

	<text>I did a quick comparison with the US Apple Store prices + 20% and UK Apple Store, then used ConvertBot App on the iPhone to calculate the equivalent cost in $'s to illustrate how much Apple gouge UK customers.Regardless of what our own government are doing, Apple's prices are so heavily marked up, it's like adding the cost of an iPod Nano to every Mac in their range, just to compensate Apple for tiny fluctuations in the exchange rate.Absolutely disgusting and why I always get a refurb or go the eBay route.The only New item I've ever bought was my iPhone and that was heavily subsidised by the 2 year mobile contract that usually leaves me with over half my available minutes and texts left unused at the end of the month.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byOptimus FragThis isn't Apple's fault. It's the ConDem coalition government's fault. Thank you Chancellor Osbourne while you're swanning off on your £8000 ski holiday. Bet he made sure that was paid off before he increased the tax.Quote:Originally Posted byOptimus FragYes, because the Prime Minister of one country was COMPLETELY responsible for the WORLD wide recession that hit everyone.It had nothing to do with multi-national, multi-billion banks gambling on sub-prime loans, nothing to do with traders speculating wildly on oil, gas and grain, nothing to do with all governments (including our own so you don't think I'm being biased) ignoring the irresponsible and reckless manner in which those institutions conducted business as long as the corporate tax revenue kept pouring in, nothing to do with the fact that when these people messed up, couldn't hide it anymore and they went hat in hand begging for governments and tax-payers to bail them out. If we were a truely capitalist society, we would have just let them go to the wall as all other failing companies should and do. But because they had become such an intrinsic part of economies we had to bail them out. And were going to paying for it for a long time to come...But all of that was one mans fault so we can just blame him and not blame ourselves for failing to hold to account those institutions by allowing ourselves to continuously to vote in weak willed politicians held in thrall by the power of multi-national corporations and lacking the backbone and courage of conviction to say NO to them when they should.When it comes to shirking responsibility perhaps it might be a good idea for everyone to look in a mirror and ask it was really a good idea to buy a lot of stuff we couldn't afford, using credit that wasn't ours. I'm guilty of that in the past (not now, got rid of my credit cards years ago, I only buy what I can pay for), I'm sure you've been guilty of it and I'm sure most of us have been in the past. When you look at yourself, ask that and answer truthfully, then you know what responsibility is.So, to be clear, it wasn't Labours fault, for all the reasons you give, but it is The Conservatives fault, who had been out of power for 14 years.Nice logic.</text>

	<text>Wooo! 0% Tax in Guernsey, Channel Isles. I think the lowest in Europe?Anyway, a 2.5% rise isn't that huge, except for very expensive items. Even a £1000 mac now costs only £20 more - and lets face it, if you're going to spend that much on a computer, the additional cost isn't really a huge factor..One thing that REALLY annoys me though is Apple TV. It's ridiculously too expensive. £101 now. LOL!</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byjameskattIn the U.S., Apple advertises the before-tax prices of its products, just like everyone else.Why not advertise the pre-VAT price of its products in England?Is it illegal to advertise the pre-VAT price in England?After all, the tax on products varies from country to country.The actual price before taxes is what the product's advertised price should be. This way, England can do what it wants with the VAT tax.  But Apple's advertised prices will be the same everywhere in the world.1. Because it's confusing and miss-leading.2. Yes, but somethings are exempt form that rule, like if you went to a wholesaler.Also may I add that we only pay 1 tax, VAT, where often in the USA and Canada the consumer pays 2 taxes.Not only that but the line of 20% VAT is about average for EU countries.Also another point to add, it's not the current government to blame, fair enough they carried out this increase but it is only an end result of our previous governments actions which has basically, royally ****ed the UK well and truly up.</text>

The number of people who got to the checkout to find that the price is actually 20% higher than they expected would soon put them off. Shops don't really like customers complaining openly.It is just the way it's done here, and in many other places. I know that many people get very confused by the pricing in the States, and can't work out why anyone would do it differently.I'm sure the government like the fact that people aren't reminded how much tax they have paid every time they shop (although many retailers do show the VAT amount on receipts), but I think the official reason for the requirement is to avoid confusion.</text>

	<text>It does make sense though - I've lost count of the number of times I've been in the USA and realised at the till that the price on the product isn't the price I'm going to pay, and the tax rate is never displayed in an obvious place for me to work it out, as it differs by state.So the law here in the UK is so that you know what the price is going to be when you pick up the item. The fact that it helps the govt obscure their tax take is a bonus for them!</text>

	<text>How is the government getting away with not telling you how much tax is paid?The rate is 20%, so take 20% off the price to find out how much VAT you pay. By law you can also request a VAT receipt as well which tells you how much VAT you pay.The simple fact is that when I see a price I know thats the price of the product, I don't have to calculate how much more on top of that I will pay, I also don't bother finding out how much tax I pay because I would have to pay it in anyway.If I have £20 in my pocket, I know that I can buy something up to the value of £20, and not something up to the value of £18.</text>

Of course, getting a discount on Apple kit is always hard, if not impossible, but you should always be able to get them to throw in something extra (worth the 2.5%) for free, ie. a copy of Battlefield 2142, a copy of Sims Complete, a 5m high-quality USB2 cable, a high-quality 2m HDMI cable, a spinle of 50 Verbatim DVD-Rs, £30 off a disk upgrade to 1TB, £60 off a 2TB enterprise disk, etc, etc. All examples of what I've got just by asking when buying a Mac at full price.</text>

	<text>To all Americans, Canadians, Swiss citizens (Switzerland is *not* part of the European Union and it actually has a reasonable VAT of 8% since the first of the year, up from 7.6% prior) and all other NON-EU nationals: You can go to ANY European country and go shopping, always keeping in mind that you will pay up to 25% LESS than EU citizens. Always ask for &quot;Export papers&quot; for any and all items you buy and you will literally get a nice, fat VAT refund check for everything you buy in overpriced Europe from the nice people at tax-refund booths, which are conveniently located at all EU airports. I go at least once a year and believe me, it adds up quickly!This concludes the Public Service Announcement from CrunchDude Circle of Love.</text>
